/// Program Stage 0, WP-2: **open-loop** scroll at a fixed 60 Hz cadence.
///
/// Notches go out on schedule whether or not the last one has been answered.
/// That is the only way to see back-pressure: a closed loop refuses to send
/// the next input until the runtime has caught up, so it can never observe a
/// runtime that has not. What this scenario produces — coalesced multi-input
/// frames, superseded presents, a growing input→commit tail — is invisible to
/// every other scenario in the suite.
///
/// Per-notch latency is deliberately **not** measured here by marker matching;
/// it is read from the runtime's own `input_to_commit_*` columns and from
/// `presents.tsv`. A per-notch marker wait would close the loop again.
///
/// **Run this in an async render mode.** Under `--mode sync` the drive is not
/// actually open-loop: the synchronous frame driver drains to quiescence
/// inside the injection task's own suspension points, so every notch gets its
/// own frame and the scenario reports no back-pressure at all. Measured on a
/// 200-row list in debug, 60 notches at 16.6 ms:
///
/// | mode | frames | frames coalescing >1 input | input→commit p50 |
/// | --- | --- | --- | --- |
/// | `sync` | 61 | 0 | 45 ms |
/// | `async` | 22 | 20 (up to 3 inputs) | 453 ms |
///
/// Same code, same cadence, an order of magnitude apart — because only one of
/// them is a race. The default mode is async for exactly this reason; the sync
/// number is not a smaller version of the async one, it is a measurement of
/// something else.
