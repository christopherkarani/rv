/// Stage 2 removed (plan 2026-07-31-002).
///
/// The default block count sits **under** the frame-head worker-snapshot
/// budget (`4 * max(columns, rows)`) on purpose: under the budget the runtime
/// pre-realizes every block on the main actor so the frame tail can offload,
/// and the resulting snapshot reports `canRunOnWorker == true` — which the
/// pre-Stage-2 windowed measurement refused, so a *small* document was
/// measured exhaustively every frame while a *large* one was windowed. Both
/// sides of the budget now window; the default keeps this scenario on the
/// snapshot-source path (the real-document regime), and raising
/// `SWIFTTUI_PERF_SCROLL_DOCUMENT_BLOCKS` above the budget still flips it
/// onto the live-source path as a consistency lever.
///
/// Both drive shapes run here, back to back, because a document's cost is not
/// the same question closed-loop and open-loop: closed-loop shows the
/// per-notch price a user pays when the runtime keeps up, open-loop shows what
/// the same document does to a runtime that cannot.
