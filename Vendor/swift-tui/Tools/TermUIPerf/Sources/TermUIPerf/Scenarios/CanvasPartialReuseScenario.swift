/// narrow invalidation and otherwise reuse-eligible — was therefore re-extracted
/// (draw + semantics) from scratch on every click frame, purely because a Canvas
/// existed elsewhere in the tree. After P1 the products are retained with a nil
/// whole-tree signature, so the per-subtree partial-reuse path reuses the static
/// grid while only the (unsupported) Canvas re-extracts.
