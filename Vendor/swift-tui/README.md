SwiftTUI is a Swift framework for building terminal user interfaces on macOS,
Linux, and Windows. You write `View` types with `@State`, stacks, controls,
focus, gestures, and animation — the declarative model SwiftUI has proven at
platform scale — and the framework owns layout, input, redraw, and the
terminal itself. The result is a native executable for the platform you build for.

> [!important]
> **Public beta.** The API is still being proven, and breaking changes can occur.
> All changes are documented in the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).  
> Pin with `.upToNextMinor`.

## The counter

This is the app behind the live demo, without the demo's ripple animation
([full source](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-counter-demo/tree/main/counter)):


```swift
import SwiftTUI

struct CounterView: View {
  @State private var count = 0

  var body: some View {
    VStack(spacing: 1) {
      TextFigure("\(count)", font: .future)
        .frame(minWidth: 14, alignment: .center)
      Button("Increment") { count += 1 }
        .buttonStyle(.bordered)
    }
    .frame(maxWidth: .infinity, maxHeight: .infinity)
  }
}

@main
struct CounterApp: App {
  var body: some Scene {
    WindowGroup("Counter") { CounterView() }
  }
}
```

Render a deterministic snapshot of a view at a chosen size. This is the
counter at 40 columns
(`RenderOnce.print(CounterView(), width: 40)`, color off):

```text
                  ┏━┓
                  ┃┃┃
                  ┗━┛

               ╭─────────╮
               │Increment│
               ╰─────────╯
```

Space activates the focused button and the figure redraws — only the cells
that changed. Ctrl-C quits and restores your shell.

### Run it

Any Swift 6.4+ toolchain builds and runs SwiftTUI apps from the command line on
macOS 15+, Linux, and Windows 10 1809+ ([swiftly](https://www.swift.org/swiftly/),
a current Xcode, or the [swift.org installer](https://www.swift.org/install/windows/)).
Add the package, depend on its `SwiftTUI` product, and `swift run`:

```swift
// Package.swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui", .upToNextMinor(from: "0.14.0")),
// in your executable target:
.product(name: "SwiftTUI", package: "swift-tui"),
```

Or clone [the demo's repo](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-counter-demo) and run its terminal target:  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-counter-demo
cd swift-tui-counter-demo
swift run --package-path counter counter
```

## Why SwiftTUI

- **State in, screen out.** Views are a pure function of your app's state:
  change a value and the runtime recomputes layout and rewrites exactly the
  cells that changed. No draw loop, no buffer diffing, no repaint bookkeeping.
- **Real components, open styles.** Buttons, text fields, pickers, sliders,
  lists, tables, tabs, sheets, and command palettes ship with built-in styles,
  and every one of the 28 style families is an open protocol: conform, then
  restyle a control, a subtree, or the whole app with one modifier. That
  includes the families SwiftUI keeps closed. See
  [The Style System](Sources/SwiftTUIViews/SwiftTUIViews.docc/Style-System.md).
- **The terminal, negotiated for you.** Truecolor, Kitty and Sixel images,
  OSC 8 hyperlinks, and mouse reporting are probed per session and degrade
  gracefully: one binary is correct in kitty, a bare SSH session, or CI. Every
  app also ships `--accessible`, `--cursor-follows-focus`, `--reduce-motion`,
  `--no-color`, and `--ascii`. You write views, not escape codes.
- **One compiled binary, testable without a TTY.** Swift 6 compiles your
  interface into a single executable with checked concurrency, and tests
  render and compare integer-cell frames like the one above with no terminal
  attached.

Coming from SwiftUI? The shape is the same; the terminal-native differences
are deliberate and recorded — read
[Coming from SwiftUI](Sources/SwiftTUIViews/SwiftTUIViews.docc/Coming-From-SwiftUI.md)
and the [divergence register](Sources/SwiftTUIViews/SwiftTUIViews.docc/Divergences-And-Gaps.md).
Choosing between TUI frameworks? See the
[comparison on swifttui.sh](https://swifttui.sh/#why).

## Built with SwiftTUI

Shapes and images share the same layout and modifier model as controls. Draw
arcs with `Angle` and `Path`, clip a subtree with `clipShape`, morph compatible
paths, and layer images in authored order. Animated GIFs preserve frame timing
and finite or continuous playback. See
[Shapes](Sources/SwiftTUIViews/SwiftTUIViews.docc/Shapes.md) and
[Animated Images](Sources/SwiftTUIAnimatedImage/SwiftTUIAnimatedImage.docc/SwiftTUIAnimatedImage.md).

Build larger interfaces from compositional lazy stacks, data-backed lists and
tables, nested scroll panes, and tabs that retain authored model state. Animated
presence changes fade by default; numeric text, keyframes, and matched geometry
make changes visible while respecting reduced motion. Explore the
[building blocks](https://swifttui.sh/capabilities/) or go directly to
[Scrolling](Sources/SwiftTUIViews/SwiftTUIViews.docc/Scrolling.md),
[Animating Views](Sources/SwiftTUIViews/SwiftTUIViews.docc/Animating-Views.md), and
[Commands and Key Input](Sources/SwiftTUIViews/SwiftTUIViews.docc/Commands-And-Key-Input.md).

## Beyond the terminal

Terminal first, not terminal only. The same `App` also runs in a browser —
launch it with `--web` to serve it over localhost, or compile it with the
`SwiftTUIWASI` product and ship it as a static bundle with
[`@swifttui/web`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-web), which is what the
live demo is — and inside native apps through
[`swift-tui-swiftui`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-swiftui) (macOS, iOS)
and [`swift-tui-android`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-android)
(arm64 preview). The browser paths paint to Canvas or DOM with a semantic accessibility
tree; none of them is a terminal emulator. For narrower product graphs — the
explicit `SwiftTUICLI` terminal runner, custom hosts, or one committed frame
rendered without a TTY — start from
[Choosing Modules And Platforms](Sources/SwiftTUI/SwiftTUI.docc/Choosing-Modules-And-Platforms.md);
the full platform-by-product matrix (including the Windows notes) is
[Hosts And Platforms](Sources/SwiftTUIRuntime/SwiftTUIRuntime.docc/Hosts-And-Platforms.md).

Shared source can adapt to its input host: visible actions and larger targets
for touch, focused commands for keyboards, and native scroll panning. Keep the
model and view tree shared while choosing suitable navigation and control
styles; see [Adapting an Interface to Its Host](Sources/SwiftTUIViews/SwiftTUIViews.docc/Adapting-To-Hosts.md).
