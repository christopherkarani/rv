# Liveness assertion for serialized test execution.
#
# The runtime lane claims to run serially (`--no-parallel`; the mitigation for
# KNOWN-TEST-FLAKES.md entry 14). Twice before, a serialization switch was
# inert while its step stayed green: a bare `--num-workers 1` died on argument
# validation, and `--parallel --num-workers 1` validated but left swift-testing
# at peak 1645 tests in flight. A green step cannot distinguish "serialized"
# from "flag ignored", so this script measures the execution shape instead:
# it parses a `swift test` log, tracks tests started minus tests completed,
# and fails when the peak in-flight count exceeds a small bound. A genuinely
# serial lane measures ~1-3; a parallel lane measures hundreds.
#
# It also fails when the log contains NO recognizable test-start events, so a
# format drift in the test runner's output breaks this check loudly instead of
# silently turning it into a fourth piece of inert tooling.
#
# Usage:
#   check_serialized_execution.sh <log-file> [max-peak]
#   check_serialized_execution.sh --self-test
#
# The bound defaults to 8 and can be set via SWIFTTUI_SERIALIZED_PEAK_MAX or
# the second argument.

# Prints "peak started finished" for a swift test log. Recognizes both
# swift-testing lines (`◇ Test x() started.` / `✔ Test x() passed after ...`,
# matched on words so the glyphs and their encoding never matter) and XCTest
# lines (`Test Case '...' started.` / `... passed (0.1 seconds)`). Suite and
# run-level lines are excluded, and so are parameterized `Test case ...`
# lines: swift-testing announces each case at start but emits no per-case
# completion (measured: 103 case starts, 0 case completions in one lane log),
# so counting them inflates a perfectly serial lane to peak ~100. Only
# top-level test events count; a serial lane measures peak 1, a parallel lane
# measures peak ~1600.
