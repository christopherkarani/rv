# Forbid bare `Thread.isMainThread` outside of justified call sites.
#
# `Thread.isMainThread` is not a portable proxy for main-actor isolation.
# On Linux's swift-corelibs Foundation it returns `false` for code
# synchronously invoked from `@MainActor` context, even though that code is
# provably on the main actor's executor. See LINUX_ISSUES.md issue #2.
#
# Use the portable `currentlyOnMainActor()` helper in
# Tests/SwiftTUITests/Support/MainActorTestSupport.swift instead. If you
# genuinely need `Thread.isMainThread` (e.g. you're implementing the helper
# itself, or you specifically want to know "is this the OS main thread?"
# regardless of actor isolation), justify the call site with a
# `thread-ismain-ok:` comment within the same line or the 3 lines above it,
# explaining why.
#
# Example of an acceptable use:
#
#     // thread-ismain-ok: bridging into a C API that requires us to be
#     // on the OS main thread; we don't care about Swift actor isolation.
#     guard Thread.isMainThread else { ... }

repo_root=$(CDPATH= cd -- "$(dirname "$0")/.." && pwd)
cd "$repo_root"

# Justification policy: the marker `thread-ismain-ok:` may appear either
# on the same line as the call, or anywhere inside the *contiguous* comment
# block (no blank lines, no code lines) immediately preceding the call.
# This lets multi-line explanations span as many lines as needed without
# an arbitrary line-count cap, while still requiring the comment to be
# adjacent enough to the call that a reader sees them together.

# Find every Swift file that mentions Thread.isMainThread (excluding the
# usual non-source dirs). For each, walk the file and emit one line per
# unjustified hit.
