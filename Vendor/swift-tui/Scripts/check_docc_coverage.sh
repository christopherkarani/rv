# DocC coverage check.
#
# Property: every `.library` product declared in Package.swift ships a DocC
# catalog, so the published reference stays complete.
#
# This check is convention-based and keeps no hand-maintained manifest. The
# DocC catalog for a target is, by repo convention, a directory named
# `<target>.docc` somewhere under Sources/, Platforms/, or Tests/ (the last for
# test-support library products such as SwiftTUITestSupport, whose catalog
# lives inside the target's own source path). The check derives the expected
# set of products straight from Package.swift and confirms each one's catalog
# exists.
#
# Scripts/lib/public_docc_targets.txt still drives Scripts/build_docc_archive.sh
# (it also lists package-only support targets such as SwiftTUICore); it is a
# build input, not validated here.
