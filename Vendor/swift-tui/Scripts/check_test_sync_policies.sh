# Ratchets timeout-driven test synchronisation toward zero.
#
# Tests must synchronise on directly-awaitable signals (AsyncEvent,
# MainActorConditionSignal, AsyncStream, an explicit `await` on a readiness
# callback) — not by polling a predicate under a timeout, sleeping a fixed
# wall-clock interval, or bridging async work through a blocking semaphore.
# Those patterns are simultaneously the flakiest and the slowest tests on a
# loaded CI runner.
#
# This is a one-way ratchet, not a hard ban: the recorded baseline counts the
# anti-pattern occurrences that still exist. New code may not push the count
# above the baseline. Converting a test lowers the count; lower the baseline
# to lock the improvement in.
#
# Matched primitives: waitUntil(, valueWithTimeout(, DispatchSemaphore,
# Task.sleep, .sleep(for:, usleep(, nanosleep(, Thread.sleep. The fixed-sleep
# forms (usleep/nanosleep/Thread.sleep) were added 2026-05-30 after a flake
# audit found they slipped past the original regex set.
#
# Baseline composition (16): 5 DispatchSemaphore barriers
# (TerminalPresentationTests x4, TerminalHostPresentationBatchingTests x1 —
# the AsyncFrameTailRenderingTests worker gate moved to Tests/Support as the
# shared AsyncFrameTailBlockingGate, where sanctioned primitives live) + 4 fixed sleeps
# (InteractiveRuntimeTests x2 usleep, AnimationRepeatForeverGrowthTests x1
# usleep, RenderDiffTests x1 Thread.sleep) + 3 process/loop watchdogs
# (EntryPointLaunchTests x1 Task.sleep, GeometryReaderSurfaceTests x1
# Task.sleep, PresentationPortalForceQueueTests x1 Task.sleep — bounds the
# scripted-input frame-condition waits so a wrong predicate fails the test
# with diagnostics instead of hanging the suite) + 2 autonomous-workload
# ticks (GeometryReaderSurfaceTests x1 Task.sleep,
# TaskReadsUnbodiedStateTests x1 Task.sleep) + 2 animation-deadline
# wall-clock waits (AnimationCompletionLifecycleOrderTests x2 Task.sleep —
# the real-time animation clock must pass a `withAnimation` deadline while
# the frame pump is deliberately HALTED, so there is no concurrent work to
# await and no signal to convert to; virtual time cannot substitute because
# deadline-triggered frames pin their instant to the stored deadline — see
# that test's doc comment).
#
# NOTE: the EntryPointLaunchTests occurrence is a *process watchdog backstop*,
# not timeout-driven synchronisation. `runFixture` reads a launched fixture's
# PTY output event-by-event and stops the moment the expected marker appears;
# the real wait is the event-driven read loop. The `Task.sleep` only arms a
# SIGKILL that fires if a wedged or never-rendering fixture would otherwise hang
# the suite forever — there is no signal to await because the failure mode is
# the absence of one. It cannot be converted to AsyncEvent/MainActorCondition-
# Signal/AsyncStream and is grandfathered like the fixed-sleep latency
# injections above.
#
# NOTE: the two GeometryReaderSurfaceTests occurrences (added 2026-06-07 with the
# autonomous-task GeometryReader coverage) are the same two grandfathered shapes,
# not the test's synchronisation. That test already synchronises on a
# `MainActorConditionSignal` (notified from the mock host's `present()`) and an
# `AsyncStream`-based quit reader awaiting `conditionSignal.wait(until:)`:
#   - The 20 ms `Task.sleep` inside `GeometryReaderAutonomousTaskProbe.body`'s
#     `.task` is the *tick interval of the autonomous workload under test* — a
#     self-driving SwiftUI `.task` that periodically mutates state. It is the
#     producer the test observes, not a waiter; converting it would delete the
#     behaviour being verified. Same category as the fixed-sleep latency
#     injections above.
#   - The multi-second `Task.sleep` in `GeometryReaderAutonomousTaskQuitInputReader`
#     is a *loop watchdog backstop*: the real wait is the adjacent
#     `conditionSignal.wait(until: shouldQuit)`; the sleep only arms a synthetic
#     ctrl-D quit if the run loop never pumps a frame, so a wedged loop fails
#     instead of hanging the suite. Same un-awaitable "absence of a signal"
#     failure mode as the EntryPointLaunchTests watchdog above.
#
# NOTE: the TaskReadsUnbodiedStateTests occurrence (added with the @State /
# `.task` stale-read coverage) is the same autonomous-workload-tick shape as the
# 20 ms GeometryReader probe above: the 5 ms `Task.sleep` inside `HeldProbe`'s
# `.task` is the frame-pacing interval of the self-driving game loop *under
# test* (it mirrors the gallery "Logo Breaker" physics loop), not a waiter. The
# test's real synchronisation is the signal-based `ScriptedAutonomousWakeInput-
# Reader` (it awaits `terminal.frameSignal` conditions), so the sleep cannot be
# converted without deleting the workload being verified.
#
# NOTE: all 4 fixed sleeps are deliberate *presentation-latency injections*
# inside mock present()/presentObserver methods — they simulate a slow terminal
# present so a test can exercise frame batching/diffing (e.g.
# runLoopBatchesQueuedScrollBursts needs present to be slow so scroll events
# queue and coalesce). They are NOT timeout-driven synchronisation; the real
# waits in those tests are already signal-based (MainActorConditionSignal). Do
# not "convert" them to signals — that would defeat the latency they inject.
# They are grandfathered into the baseline so the ratchet still blocks *new*
# fixed sleeps. The lasting fix is to route latency injection through a named
# Tests/Support helper the regex can exclude (then drop the baseline to 6); the
# DispatchSemaphore barriers are the genuine sync anti-pattern to ratchet down.
