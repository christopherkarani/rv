Usage: Scripts/test_all.sh [--clean] [--skip-bun-install] [--lane <lane>]

Runs the exhaustive checked-in repo verification surface:
  - checked-in policy hooks
  - stable-doc source-path guardrails
  - explicit layout work-stack guardrails
  - per-step watchdog self-test
  - serialized-execution check for the runtime lane (plus its self-test)
  - per-test duration ratchet for the runtime shards (plus its self-test;
    SWIFTTUI_STRESS_FULL=1 runs the full churn-loop counts and skips it)
  - frame-tail tree-walker recursion guardrails (plus their self-test)
  - public DocC catalog and website build guardrails
  - root Package.swift test-target coverage guardrails
  - rendered-text fixture matrix guardrails
  - public-API baseline freshness check
  - focused root SwiftPM framework tests, with high-contention async runtime
    suites isolated from the broad SwiftTUI runtime step
  - focused SwiftTUIArguments tests
  - focused SwiftTUICLI tests
  - focused PTY primitive tests
  - focused SwiftTUIWASI / SwiftTUIWASISurfaceBridge tests
  - focused SwiftTUIWebHost tests
  - focused SwiftTUIAndroidHost tests
  - Tools/TermUIPerf tests

The script also checks required environment dependencies up front:
  - Swift 6.4.x via `swiftly`
  - Bun availability
  - Bun workspace dependencies via `bun install --frozen-lockfile` at the repo root

On Linux, the script also:
  - exports `DISABLE_EXPLICIT_PLATFORMS=1` for repo package resolution

Pass --skip-bun-install to reuse the existing Bun install state.

Pass --lane to run one CI lane of the surface instead of all of it:
  all              every step below, in one process (the default; `bun run test`)
  policy           the toolchain-free policy phase, guardrails, and self-tests
  core             build once; every non-runtime test target in one parallel
                   launch; the isolated SwiftTUITests suites; entry-point
                   launch fixtures and tests
  runtime:<shard>  one serialized SwiftTUITests shard from
                   Scripts/data/runtime-shards.txt, plus its
                   serialized-execution check
The three CI lanes partition the `all` surface exactly; the soundness-trace
scan runs in `all` and, for CI, once over the merged traces of every lane
(.github/workflows/run-tests-linux.yml).

Pass --clean to delete every SwiftPM `.build` directory before any step
runs. The satellite packages reached via `--package-path` rebuild the repo's
module graph inside their own `.build`, and SwiftPM's incremental tracking
across that package boundary can leave a stale object linked against a
since-changed symbol. --clean trades a from-scratch rebuild for a run that
cannot be tripped by that staleness.

Each step is bounded by SWIFTTUI_TEST_STEP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS, defaulting to 1200
seconds. This bounds SILENCE, not total runtime: the watchdog fires when a step
has produced no output for that long, so a lane running slowly under contention
is not killed like one that parked, while a genuinely wedged lane still dies.
Set it to 0 to disable the per-step watchdog for local diagnosis.
A step that is quiet but whose process tree still averages at least
SWIFTTUI_TEST_STEP_BUSY_MIN_CPU_PERCENT (default 25) of a core is treated as
working — the block-buffered-writer case — for up to
SWIFTTUI_TEST_STEP_BUSY_GRACE_SECONDS (default: half the idle bound) in total.
The worst-case kill time is therefore the sum of those two plus
SWIFTTUI_TEST_TIMEOUT_KILL_GRACE_SECONDS, and setting
SWIFTTUI_TEST_STEP_WATCHDOG_DEADLINE_SECONDS to the job's own cap makes the
runner refuse to start if that sum could not fire inside it.
SWIFTTUI_TEST_STEP_ABSOLUTE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS (default: 4x the idle bound, 0 to
disable) is the backstop for a step that livelocks while still printing.
After a timeout, the runner sends SIGTERM to the step's process tree, waits
SWIFTTUI_TEST_TIMEOUT_KILL_GRACE_SECONDS seconds, then sends SIGKILL before
printing the captured log and failing the gate.

For the curated repo gate, use Scripts/test_gate.sh. That runner keeps the same
post-split non-example surface and writes a shorter test-gate log name.

Set SWIFTTUI_SKIP_PUBLIC_API_BASELINE=1 when the public API baseline is covered by
the separate CI workflow. Set SWIFTTUI_SKIP_TERMUIPERF=1 when Tools/TermUIPerf is
covered by its path-filtered or scheduled workflow.

#     from stressIterations(full:hotPath:). Under SWIFTTUI_STRESS_FULL=1 the
