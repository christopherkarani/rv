# Verify the Foundation-free engine layers never load Foundation through ANY
# transitive dependency.
#
# The `no-foundation-in-library-products` pre-commit hook greps a fixed set of
# source directories for `import Foundation`. That is fast but blind to
# Foundation arriving through a dependency whose directory nobody remembered to
# add to the list. This check instead follows real package resolution: it builds
# the layers with the Swift compiler's `-emit-loaded-module-trace`, which makes
# each module emit a `<Module>.trace.json` listing every `.swiftmodule` it
# actually loaded transitively. We then assert no Foundation module appears.
#
# Scope: SwiftTUICore and SwiftTUIViews — the layers that are Foundation-free
# through their *entire* transitive graph. Checking them also covers the vendored
# SwiftTUIVendorFiglet / SwiftTUIVendorFigletEmbeddedFonts modules they depend
# on (sources still live under Vendor/swift-figlet/). The `SwiftTUI` convenience
# product is intentionally NOT checked here: it re-exports the terminal/WebHost
# runner products, which legitimately use Foundation, so it is Foundation-free
# only at the source level (the no-foundation hook covers that).
#
# `_DarwinFoundation1/2/3` are stdlib Darwin overlays present even in pure-stdlib
# code; they are deliberately not treated as Foundation here.
#
# Two modes:
#   (no arguments)      build the layers into .build/foundation-audit with the
#                       trace flag and audit that scratch (self-contained; for
#                       ad-hoc use).
#   --trace-dir <dir>   audit the traces of an EXISTING build whose every swiftc
#                       invocation carried `-emit-loaded-module-trace` (the repo
#                       gate's lanes build this way — Scripts/test_all.sh
#                       `emit_module_trace`), so the audit costs no second
#                       compile. <dir> is typically `.build/debug`.
#   --dump <file>       also write the sorted list of local modules the walk
#                       visited (used once to prove the two modes equivalent).
