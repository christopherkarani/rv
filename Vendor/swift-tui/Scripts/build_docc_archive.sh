Builds the combined DocC archive for every DocC target listed in
Scripts/lib/public_docc_targets.txt. That manifest is scoped to the app-facing
published reference: products an app imports, host/integration products, and
the engine modules whose re-exported vocabulary surfaces in app code. Targets
that are intentionally unpublished are recorded in the manifest header.
