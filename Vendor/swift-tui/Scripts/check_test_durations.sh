# Per-test duration ratchet for the serialized runtime shards
# (swift-tui-org plan 2026-08-25-001, Stage 2b).
#
# Every hot-path test is expected to finish in <= 10 s; the churn loops that
# used to take 12-55 s read their iteration count from
# `stressIterations(full:hotPath:)` (Tests/Support/StressIterations.swift) and
# run the full count only under SWIFTTUI_STRESS_FULL=1 (the nightly and tag
# lanes). This script parses a `swift test` log and reports every test whose
# `passed/failed after N seconds` line exceeds the WARN bound, and fails the
# step when one exceeds the FAIL bound.
#
# Two bounds, not one: the amd64 runner class varies by 2x between runs
# (KNOWN-TEST-FLAKES.md entry 12), so a single 10 s hard bound would turn the
# ratchet itself into a flake source. The hard bound therefore sits at 2x the
# target; the target is reported so a creeping test is visible on every run.
#
# Only meaningful on a --no-parallel log: under parallel execution a test's
# reported duration includes contention from its neighbours.
#
# Usage:
#   check_test_durations.sh <log-file> [fail-seconds] [warn-seconds]
#   check_test_durations.sh --self-test
#
# Defaults: FAIL 20 (SWIFTTUI_TEST_DURATION_FAIL_SECONDS),
#           WARN 10 (SWIFTTUI_TEST_DURATION_WARN_SECONDS).

# Prints "<seconds>\t<test name>" for every completed top-level test in the
# log, both swift-testing (`Test x() passed after 1.2 seconds`) and XCTest
# (`Test Case '-[M.C t]' passed (1.2 seconds)`). Suite and run-level lines
# are excluded; parameterized `Test case` lines never carry a duration.
