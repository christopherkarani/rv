# Reuse and invalidation

Learn how SwiftTUI turns value changes into graph work. See how it safely serves
a resolved subtree again and keeps structural churn within its ownership.

This article describes the current `SwiftTUIGraph` implementation. The types
that own the policy are package-internal, but their contracts are load-bearing
for state, focus, presentation, runtime registrations, and every host.

## The two-channel invalidation model

SwiftTUI has two related channels of change.

The **value-change channel** begins when a tracked value publishes a change.
`@State` writes use `ViewNode.setStateSlot`, and Swift Observation callbacks use
the graph's observation-change path. Both identify the actual reader whenever
possible, mark its `ViewNode` dirty, and send invalidated identities through the
frame scheduler. At the next frame boundary, the graph reconciles its
invalidated and graph-local-dirty rails. It removes dirty descendants that
dirty ancestors already cover. Then it builds a `DirtyEvaluationPlan`. Its
frontier is the smallest set of stitchable evaluators that covers the known
dirty work. If the graph cannot form that proof, resolve starts at the root.

The **structural-churn channel** begins while resolve evaluates those frontier
targets or the root. Some topology changes cannot be expressed as another
tracked value read. Examples include a new child list or a presentation- or
preference-derived subtree. A different live parent can also adopt a child.
Those paths propagate `withinChurnedSubtree` and update `CommittedFreshness`.
They reconcile parent and `evaluationHost` relationships. They also enqueue
teardown work. The paths force fresh resolution inside the affected cone. An
identity-only invalidation test can miss this change.

Resolve is where the channels meet. Every reached node first asks the reuse
door whether its committed subtree is servable. A decline evaluates the authored
body and can produce structural churn. An acceptance restores the subtree's
runtime registrations and reports its retained lifetime without re-running the
body. After resolve, `ViewGraphFrameDraft` publishes the graph's recorded
runtime-registration state into the live dispatch registries. The teardown
barrier then settles structural departures before the frame becomes committed
truth.

## Vocabulary

The following terms are normative in this repository and appear in dependency
order.

**Publication.** In graph code, publication means making the registrations
recorded on `ViewNode`s visible in the live runtime registries. It is not a
synonym for invalidation. `ViewGraphFrameDraft.RuntimeRegistrationPublication`
in `Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Resolve/ViewGraphFrameDraft.swift` selects
`.unchanged`, `.subtrees`, or `.all` behavior after resolve. State and
Observation "publish" value changes in the general Observation sense, but their
graph effect is to request invalidation and queue dirty work.

**Fingerprint.** A fingerprint is an equality-friendly projection used where
the underlying registration closures cannot be compared. The production
`RuntimeRegistrationGraphFingerprint` in
`Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Resolve/ViewGraphRuntimeRegistrationFingerprint.swift`
maps node IDs to subtree roots, resolved identities, and mutation generations
so publication can compute a removal/restoration delta. The sampled publication
oracle separately uses `RuntimeRegistrationFingerprintBuilder` in
`Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Runtime/RuntimeRegistryLifecycle.swift` to compare
`registry|key` counts from the live registries with a scratch full rebuild.

**Frontier.** A frontier is the highest set of graph-local dirty nodes that no
queued dirty ancestor covers. The graph hoists these nodes to evaluators whose
output can be stitched into the committed frame.
`ViewGraphDirtyEvaluationPlanner` in
`Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Resolve/ViewGraphDirtyEvaluationPlanning.swift` computes
the targets, and `DirtyEvaluationPlan` in
`Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Resolve/ViewGraphState.swift` records their node IDs and
identities. The graph never partially accepts a target-less frontier. It raises
an oracle signal and escalates to root evaluation.

**Cone.** A cone is the self/ancestor/descendant region whose output can be
affected by a change. `InvalidationSummary` in
`Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Commit/InvalidationSummary.swift` precomputes the
identity-axis relationships used by retained reuse, while live structural
comparisons cover re-rooted identities and island seams. A **churned cone** is the
downward scope of `ResolveContext.withinChurnedSubtree` in
`Sources/SwiftTUIViews/Environment/ResolveContext.swift`. It marks a
value-derived or host-reconstructed structural change. Both reuse layers must
stop inside this scope, even if the ordinary invalidation cone does not name
the descendants.

**Rail.** A rail is one of the graph's parallel work ledgers.
`invalidatedNodeIDs` records which live nodes must deny reuse.
`graphLocalDirtyNodeIDs` records which nodes have queued evaluator work.
`ViewGraphInvalidationPlanner` in
`Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Resolve/ViewGraphInvalidationPlanning.swift` writes the
rails, and the inter-rail reconciliation in `ViewGraph.swift` unions live
invalidated nodes into the dirty rail before frontier planning. The distinction
is intentional. Rail drift can broaden evaluation but must never drop work.

**Strand.** A strand is graph state that remains stored, listed, or published
after it loses the ownership path that makes it reachable or retires it.
Examples include an unreachable node spared by a superseded pass and a
fresh node that still lists a child seated under another live parent.
`ViewGraphSubtreeRemoval.swift`, `TeardownBarrierWork.swift`, and
`ViewGraphStrandedListingProbe.swift` contain the removal and detection seams.
A departed node is not automatically a strand: durable lifetime anchors,
in-flight interaction preservation, and genuine same-frame re-adoption are
explicitly adjudicated.

**Island.** An island is resolved content whose live node chain does not reach
its host through `parent`, usually because content was capture-hosted or
identity-re-rooted. `ViewNode.evaluationHost` in
`Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Resolve/ViewNode.swift` is the bridge. Dirty-frontier,
staleness, event-bubble, and reuse-intersection walks use
`parent ?? evaluationHost` where host reachability matters. Structural
lifecycle walks retain strict-parent semantics where an island
must not count as an ordinary child.

**Servable.** A committed subtree is servable when a reuse layer has enough
evidence to return it instead of evaluating the body. Servability is a
gate-specific verdict, not a synonym for "stored," "fresh," or "live."
`CommittedFreshness.canServeValueBlind` and `.canServeMemo` in
`Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Resolve/CommittedFreshness.swift` provide the stamp leg.
The remaining proof comes from `ViewNode.canReuse`, `ViewNode.canMemoReuse`,
invalidation intersection, environment equality, transaction equivalence,
suppression, and dependency coverage.

**Freshness stamp.** A freshness stamp is one component of
`CommittedFreshness` in
`Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Resolve/CommittedFreshness.swift`. Its three verdicts are
**fresh** (`isCommittedSnapshotFresh`), **island-stale**
(`hasStaleIslandDescendant`), and **foreign-parented**
(`hasForeignParentedChild`). These verdicts are independent. A snapshot that
can be rebuilt through ordinary children cannot necessarily be rebuilt across
an island. A listed child under another parent cannot propagate staleness to
its former owner.

**Reuse door.** The reuse door is the single resolve-time policy seam,
`ViewGraph.reuseResolvedSubtree(inputs:viewValue:)` in
`Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Resolve/ViewGraphReuseDoor.swift`. Every `resolveView`
entry presents a `ReuseDecisionInputs` value to it. The door owns retained-
before-memo ordering, stack-lean policy, suppression, the two exceptional
certification legs, denial tracing, and the common acceptance plumbing.

**Suppression scope.** A suppression scope is a finite set of identities that
must recompute for a frame cause not completely represented by ordinary
invalidation. `RetainedReuseSuppressionScope` in
`Sources/SwiftTUIViews/Environment/FrameResolveState.swift` models focus and
press members plus an all-tree fallback. Its matching covers each member and
the ancestors needed to reach it. It also covers dependent presentation in
descendants, with narrowly declared inert and value-verified slot exemptions.

**Oracle.** An oracle is an independently evaluated invariant. It can reveal a
false reuse, lost dirty target, incoherent stamp, or stranded ownership claim
even when visible output looks correct. The graph records them through
`SoundnessProbeConfiguration` in
`Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Resolve/SoundnessProbeConfiguration.swift`. The
canonical enforcement, sampling, residual, and test-owner inventory is
contributor-facing and maintained in the repository's

## The reuse door

`resolveView` assembles `ReuseDecisionInputs`. Policy does not remain split
across call sites. Each field has one role:

| Field | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `identity` | The authored identity whose existing `ViewNode` and committed value are candidates. |
| `invalidatedIdentities` | The current frame's raw invalidation set. It supplies precise conflict comparisons and the memo layer's self-invalidated veto. |
| `invalidationSummary` | The precomputed identity and structural-path projection. Retained reuse reads it before its live-graph structural comparison. |
| `environment` | The current `EnvironmentSnapshot`. Both layers require equality with the committed snapshot for covered environment values. |
| `transaction` | The current `TransactionSnapshot`. Both layers require reuse-equivalent animation intent and batch metadata. |
| `allowsEmptyInvalidation` | A certificate that a finite suppression scope completely names why an otherwise empty-invalidation frame is evaluating. |
| `invalidator` | The current invalidation target installed on reused nodes so later state and observation changes still schedule work. |
| `uncoveredEnvironmentKeys` | Focus and press keys excluded from snapshot equality. A memo candidate that read one is not dependency-covered. |
| `suppressesRetainedReuse` | The broad focus/press scope verdict for value-blind retained reuse. |
| `suppressesValueVerifiedReuse` | The narrower scope verdict after value-verified slot exemptions. It is a subset of `suppressesRetainedReuse`. |
| `withinChurnedSubtree` | The propagated structural-churn marker. Both layers must decline when it is set. |
| `structuralPath` | The caller's current structural position, written onto a served result before it returns. |
| `runtimeRegistrations` | The current pass's registration intake, into which acceptance restores the served subtree's recorded registrations. |

The door always asks **Layer A, retained reuse**, first. Layer A is value-blind.
The node must have existed at frame start. It must remain unvisited and clean,
carry a value-blind-servable committed snapshot, and support retained reuse.
It must match the environment and reuse-equivalent transaction. It must also
be disjoint from invalidation on both identity and live structural axes. A hit snapshots the
node, records the subtree as retained, and ends the decision.

Only after a Layer-A miss does the door ask **Layer B, memoized-body reuse**.
This layer exists for a node reached below a re-evaluated ancestor. It still
requires a clean, unvisited, memo-servable node. It also requires an equal
environment, a reuse-equivalent transaction, and no self invalidation. No
state, Observation, or focus/press dependency can remain uncovered. An
ancestor-side invalidation match is expected and exempt, but an invalidation
inside the served subtree vetoes the serve: a descendant reader re-runs
through its own identity, and serving its ancestor wholesale would replay the
stale committed child. The value test then runs through
`MemoValueComparator.compareForReuse`, which dispatches a comparison plan
built once per type. An `Equatable` value keeps its own `==`. A POD value
compares by bytes. Other certified layouts compare field by field. An
unplannable value (closure captures, `AnyView`, opaque existentials) is
skipped rather than reflected over, so a directly `Equatable` view or an
`EquatableView` or `.equatable()` boundary remains the widest opt-in while
the plan tiers extend the same gate to value-only types that never opted in.
The comparator does not reflect at compare time. The reflective comparator
belongs only to the sampled shadow oracle.

State read certificates name the immutable owner lifetime, slot identifier and
exact replacement token observed by the reader. The current implementation
certifies `Bool`, signed and unsigned integer scalars, `Float`, `Double` and
`String`. Every store advances the token, including an equal-value store;
restoring a checkpoint restores its token without recycling discarded tokens.
Different versions read during one evaluation fail closed. Reference models,
containers, pointers and opaque values remain uncovered because replacement
alone cannot prove their contents unchanged.

Observation certificates require both an unfired callback and a current
registration for that owner lifetime. Callback currency is synchronized and
monotonic outside checkpoint state: restoring a graph and registration snapshot
cannot revive a fired one-shot callback. A fresh evaluation renews registration
and replaces conditional read dependencies. Pruning or discarding a registration
also invalidates its certificate. Memo serves preserve the existing live
registration. Explicit observable reads without a tracking bridge fail closed.
These checks cover all recorded observation scopes, including direct property
reads that do not pass through a framework property wrapper.

Before serving a whole memoized subtree, the graph validates read certificates
on its graph children and stamped committed-value islands. This is a subtree
walk, not a constant-time gate. It prevents an unchanged ancestor from hiding a
silently replaced descendant state value or an observation fire awaiting the
main-actor invalidation drain.

Both layers share the same acceptance path. `recordReusedSubtree` refreshes the
retained root and its invalidator. The door restores recorded runtime
registrations into the pass and rewrites the caller's structural path. It then
reports the resolved lifetime result. A layer is not permitted to invent a narrower
accept path that bypasses these effects.

The door also relies on `resolveView` preserving the authoring-owner seam when
a dirty frontier invokes a stored evaluator. A node-backed style body roots its
interior state slots on the live style-body node while its registrations remain
owned by the stable enclosing control. The evaluator therefore captures the
same `authoringContextOverride` used by the original resolve. Before storage,
it strips the live `viewNode` reference. It then rebases onto the fresh fire-site
node. Dropping the override degrades imperative state writes to detached seed
storage. Retaining the live node creates an ownership cycle. Separately,
structural invalidation walks bridge `parent ?? evaluationHost` and remap an
unmapped invalidated identity to its nearest live ancestor. If no ancestor
exists, they deny reuse for that frame. These steps are prerequisites for a
sound reuse decision across style and capture-host islands.

### The two certification legs

Most accepts prove safety by nonempty invalidation disjointness. Two paths need
an additional certificate:

1. **Empty-invalidation certification.** A focus/press-only frame can be forced
   while carrying no ordinary invalidated identity.
   `allowsEmptyInvalidation` can be true only when a finite, nonempty
   `RetainedReuseSuppressionScope` completely names the cause. The caller tests
   suppression before opening the door, so a node that reaches Layer A lies
   outside every named recompute cone. Environment and transaction equality
   complete its proof. Without that certificate, an empty invalidation set
   proves nothing and Layer A declines.
2. **Memo focus exemption.** A control can declare a focus-presentation
   **value-verified** slot whose handed-down value contains every focus-derived
   input. Value-blind Layer A stays suppressed under that slot. Layer B can use
   the narrower `suppressesValueVerifiedReuse` verdict. `Equatable` equality
   shows whether the value changed. Exact members and ancestors are never
   exempt. Uncovered focus or press environment reads still deny reuse. A
   DEBUG assertion also makes sure that an accepted subtree has no wholesale
   runtime-focus dependency.

Engine-profile policy is part of the door, not a host call-site choice. The
full/native profile offers both layers. The stack-lean profile disables
memoized reuse and selective evaluation. Retained reuse is also off unless
`SWIFTTUI_LEAN_RETAINED_REUSE=1` opts into the descent-shortening Layer-A path.
The canonical host/profile matrix and environment switches live in the
`SwiftTUIRuntime` catalog's

article.

## Freshness stamps and servability

`CommittedFreshness` is a three-bit algebra with named transitions:

| Transition | Fresh | Island-stale | Foreign-parented |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Initial node | `false` | `false` | `false` |
| `commitApplied()` | `true` | `false` | `false` |
| `snapshotRefreshed()` | `true` | unchanged | unchanged |
| `markChildReseated()` | unchanged | unchanged | `true` |
| `markDescendantChanged(crossingIslandSeam: false)` | `false` | unchanged | unchanged |
| `markDescendantChanged(crossingIslandSeam: true)` | unchanged | `true` | unchanged |

An ordinary descendant change clears freshness so `snapshot()` can rebuild the
committed value from live children. After a staleness walk crosses
`evaluationHost`, it sets island-stale instead. A rebuild from only live
`children` can omit the capture-hosted interior. It can then mark that truncated
value as fresh. A competing apply sets foreign-parented when it seats a listed
child under a different parent. Future upward staleness walks follow the new
parent and cannot reach the old lister.

The service queries intentionally differ:

- `canServeValueBlind` requires fresh and neither island-stale nor
  foreign-parented.
- `canServeMemo` requires fresh and not island-stale. The memo layer allows a
  foreign-parented child only because it independently compares the view value
  before serving.
- `hasFreshCommittedSnapshot` controls whether `snapshot()` can return the
  committed value without rebuilding. It does not authorize reuse by itself.

Retained write-back has its own admission test. `applyRetainedSnapshot`
receives a value whose gate passed earlier in the frame, but
`snapshotRefreshed()` restores only freshness. It therefore asserts
`admitsRetainedWriteBack` before the refresh: island-stale or
foreign-parented must not have flipped in the interval. DEBUG traps at the
write site. Sampled release probing records the same stamp-coherence failure.
The rebuild path does not use this admission comparison. A rebuild of an
island-stale node from its ordinary live children is a legitimate intermediate
operation. Its island denial must remain set.

Freshness is not liveness. Structural removal can encounter a node visited by a
reused or superseded same-frame pass. A removal cascade can provisionally spare
that descendant, but it enqueues `TeardownWorkReason.sparedVisitedDescent`
instead of treating "visited" or "served" as a right to survive. Once all
applies have settled, `settleTeardownBarrier` in `ViewGraph.swift` runs a
fixed-point reachability adjudication: a durable anchor or committed-root path
keeps the node. Otherwise, `SubtreeRemovalPolicy.barrierAdjudicated` removes the
strand and repeats for newly exposed descendants. Fresh stamps alone do not let
SwiftTUI serve a snapshot *across* that departure boundary. The
reuse door's structural intersection denies the departing cone, and the barrier
owns the final liveness verdict.

## Suppression scopes and cones

Focus and press changes are not represented completely by ordinary environment
snapshot equality: the high-churn `focusedIdentity` and `pressedIdentity` side
fields are deliberately excluded. The run loop therefore builds a
`RetainedReuseSuppressionScope` from runtime readers and old/new focus or press
identities. `ResolveContext.effectiveSuppressesRetainedReuse` applies the broad
verdict to Layer A. `effectiveSuppressesValueVerifiedReuse` applies the narrower
value-verified verdict to Layer B.

A scope member normally suppresses itself, the ancestors resolve must traverse
to reach it, and descendants whose presentation can depend on it. Two
declarations narrow only the descendant leg:

- a **focus-presentation-inert slot** promises that its handed-down value cannot
  vary with the declaring control's own focus or press presentation. Both reuse
  layers can treat that descendant match as exempt.
- a **focus-presentation value-verified slot** can hand down a changing value.
  Layer A remains suppressed, and only Layer B can compare equality.

An exact member, an ancestor of a member, or a separate wholesale focus reader
is never exempt. This keeps evaluation connected to every real reader while
preventing a near-root control from blanketing an unrelated content subtree.

`withinChurnedSubtree` handles a different proof gap. Presentation-entry
changes, preference-derived overlays/backgrounds, tab bodies, trigger leaves,
and similar values synthesized during resolve can change descendants without
creating a tracked invalidation for those descendants. The marker is inherited
by every derived `ResolveContext`. The reuse door declines both layers until it
resolves and commits the fresh values. This stand-down is
orthogonal to focus/press suppression: a node must pass both policies.

## The DEBUG oracle suite

The reuse subsystem's local oracles are deliberately small:

- `ViewGraph.strandedFreshServableViolations()` walks live node objects at the
  sampled `finalizeFrame` barrier. It reports a node whose freshness stamps
  claim ownership of a child seated under another parent. In DEBUG, any report
  also traps.
- `ViewNode.assertResolvedStampsCoherent` makes sure that the runtime-node IDs in
  a supposedly fully stamped resolved value agree with the live paired nodes.
  `applyRetainedSnapshot` separately asserts the retained write-back admission
  interval. Sampled release probes record both classes through
  `recordStampCoherenceViolation`.
- The memo shadow path recomputes sampled nodes that the production path can
  skip. It compares their
  fresh output with the committed output. A no-reads content divergence records
  `memo-unsound-skip`. The production gate dispatches per-type comparison
  plans and never reflects; reflection belongs to this oracle alone.
