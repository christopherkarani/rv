// Bulk operations over the runtime registration set.
//
// `RuntimeRegistrationSet.swift` defines the aggregate and how it is
// constructed; this file owns the operations the run loop drives across every
// member registry each frame: full reset, subtree removal, orphaned-gesture
// pruning, restoration from committed node handlers, diagnostics, and
// frame-drop eligibility blockers.
//
// Every operation is a loop over `allRegistries` through the `RuntimeRegistry`
// lifecycle contract, so a member registry participates in each fan-out by
// construction. Cross-registry inputs (the mid-interaction gesture identities
// the pointer/gesture/gesture-state teardown spares) are snapshotted into the
// context BEFORE the loop so no registry observes another's partial teardown.
