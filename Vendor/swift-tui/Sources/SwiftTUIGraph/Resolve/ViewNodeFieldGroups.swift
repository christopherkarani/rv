// Cohesive value-typed field groups for ViewNode's reconciliation state.
//
// Each group clusters a set of stored properties that share a purpose and a
// checkpoint lifetime. ViewNode stores one instance of each group and exposes
// every original field as a computed accessor that forwards into its group, so
// the reconciliation body reads and writes the fields by their original names
// while makeCheckpoint/restoreCheckpoint move whole groups by value.
//
// Grouping collapses the four hand-maintained mirrors of each field (the stored
// declaration, ViewNode.Checkpoint, makeCheckpoint, restoreCheckpoint) into a
// single whole-struct copy: a field added to a group is checkpointed and
// restored automatically, so it cannot silently fall out of rollback.
// ViewGraphCheckpointTotalityTests keeps the group fields and the flat debug
// snapshot in lockstep.
//
// This mirrors the ViewGraph decomposition in ViewGraphFieldGroups.swift and
// continues the consolidation begun in Item 6 (which folded ~14 scattered
// render mirrors into the single `committed: ResolvedNode`). Decomposition is
// staged one group per change; FrameState is the first.
