// The committed-snapshot freshness module: the per-node stamps that decide
// whether a retained committed snapshot may be served in place of a body
// re-run, owned behind named transitions so every writer states *what
// happened* and the stamp semantics live in exactly one place.

/// Freshness verdicts for one node's `committed` snapshot.
///
/// Three stamps, three distinct set-rules:
///
/// - `isCommittedSnapshotFresh` — the committed snapshot still mirrors the
///   live descendants. Cleared along live `parent` links by the upward
///   staleness walk; restored by the node's own apply or by a
///   snapshot-rebuild/retained write-back.
/// - `hasStaleIslandDescendant` — a descendant behind an island seam (a node
///   reachable only via `evaluationHost`) changed. Kept separate from
///   freshness deliberately: `snapshot()`'s rebuild-from-live-children cannot
///   span an island seam, so clearing freshness above one would graft a
///   structurally truncated tree and launder it as fresh.
/// - `hasForeignParentedChild` — a child this node still lists was adopted
///   under a DIFFERENT live parent, so the upward walks can never reach this
///   node through that child again and its committed snapshot may silently
///   age (the divergent-resolvedIdentity capture-host orphaning class).
///
/// The two service queries encode which gates honor which stamps. The memo
/// exemption — ``canServeMemo`` ignores `hasForeignParentedChild` — is
/// deliberate: the memo gate's view-value equality is an independent
/// freshness proof for the served subtree, and `.equatable()` boundaries
/// routinely have their single child absorbed into an ancestor's pairing.
