// checkpoint lifetime. ViewGraph stores one instance of each group and exposes
// every original field as a private computed accessor that forwards into its
// group, so the reconciliation body reads and writes the fields by their
// original names while makeCheckpoint/restoreCheckpoint move whole groups.
//
// Adding a field to any group automatically extends the checkpoint and debug
// snapshot contracts; ViewGraphCheckpointTotalityTests fails until the new
// field appears in both.
