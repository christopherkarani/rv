// The reader-scoped environment toleration: what the reuse door consults in
// place of whole-snapshot environment equality.
//
// Whole-snapshot equality (`committed.environmentSnapshot == environment`) is
// correct but blunt. An authored `.environment(K, v)` whose value changes
// denies EVERY reuse door beneath the writer, so the writer's whole cone
// re-descends even though only actual readers of `K` can observe the change.
// This narrows the denial to the keys a candidate subtree can actually
// observe, and repays the staleness a serve leaves behind (see
// "Drift", below).
//
// The soundness argument has exactly two legs, and both are load-bearing:
//
//  1. **Attribution is complete for the tolerated keys.** Outside this
//     framework's own modules an environment value is reachable only through
//     attributed surfaces (`@Environment` and the wrappers composed on it),
//     each of which records a read. Framework-declared keys are excluded by
//     default in `EnvironmentKeyReuseClassification` because framework
//     resolve/draw code also reads them *without* attribution
//     (`EnvironmentValues[untracked:]`, style extraction, stack-axis reads),
//     so no reader-set argument holds for them. The exception is the
//     individually certified keys, for which the same completeness claim as
//     for user keys has been established by measurement (the memo shadow
//     oracle), not by read-site audit.
//  2. **The subtree contains no interior writer of a changed key.** An
//     interior `.environment(K, …)` makes its subtree's value for `K`
//     authored rather than inherited, which decouples it from the boundary's
//     change — including the case no diff can see, where the interior write
//     happens to author the boundary's *prior* value. Denying on any interior
//     writer also makes the repair uniform: a served subtree is
//     writer-free by construction, so there is no interior boundary at which
//     a repair would have to stop.

// A tolerated serve leaves the subtree's stored environment behind: every node
// under the boundary keeps the snapshot it was resolved with, and — the part
// that matters for correctness — every evaluator closure captured inside it
// keeps the `ResolveContext.environmentValues` of the frame it was captured
// on. A later dirty-frontier re-run of such a closure whose body *newly* reads
// a tolerated key (a conditional read that did not fire on the resolve that
// recorded the dependency, so no reader edge exists to deny the serve) would
// observe the stale value. SwiftUI semantics require the current one.
//
// "Drift" is the repair: the boundary records the tolerated keys' current
// values, and a frontier re-entry inside that boundary folds them into its
// captured context before the body runs.
//
// Drift is only ever *read* on a re-entry path, because it is cleared before
// any fresh descent can reach it: `beginEvaluation` drops drift at the
// evaluating node and everything below it, and a fresh descent to a drifted
// node necessarily passes through an ancestor's `beginEvaluation` first.
