/// Memoization soundness diagnostics. Answers the design's kill-gate question —
/// *how many recomputed nodes per interaction frame would have been memoizable,
/// and is skipping them sound* — without changing any behavior.
///
/// The observer is active on every frame in DEBUG/test builds and sampled
/// 1-in-256 in release by default (F90, mirroring the F34 soundness-probe
/// promotion); `SWIFTTUI_MEMO_TRACE=0` opts out. Trace lines are emitted only
/// when the env flag or `SWIFTTUI_MEMO_TRACE_FILE` is present, so the default
/// oracle does not spam stderr. On a sampled frame the resolver additionally
/// stashes every recomputed view value (not just `Equatable` ones), so the
/// frame after a sampled frame pays the production gate's guard chain for
/// those nodes — the same bounded, vanishes-in-profiles trade F34 made.
///
/// Per resolve pass, for every node an ancestor re-ran and reached (i.e. a node
/// recomputed *not* because it was itself invalidated):
///
/// - `computed` — recomputed nodes considered.
/// - `addressableMemoSkip` — view value structurally equal to the committed
///   value, passed the non-dirty reuse guards, **and the freshly recomputed
///   output proved byte-identical to the prior committed output** (the shadow
///   oracle). These are the sound memoization wins.
/// - `unsoundSkip` — the same, but the recomputed output **differed**: a node
///   whose view value looked equal yet whose body produced a different result
///   (the closure-captured-out-of-band-state hazard). Split three ways: nodes
///   with recorded dynamic reads (a changed read legitimately changes output),
///   no-reads nodes whose divergence is per-resolve entity bookkeeping only
///   (over-strict oracle fields, tracked in the histogram), and no-reads nodes
///   with a **content** divergence — a comparator false-equal. The content
///   class must stay 0; it raises the memo-soundness alarm
///   (``SoundnessProbeConfiguration/recordMemoUnsoundSkip(_:)``), which the
///   run loop routes to the host as a `RuntimeIssue`.
/// - `blocked*` — nodes the comparator could not reason about (closure / AnyView
///   / opaque existential fields). The interactive-leaf ceiling.
///
/// `ViewGraph.beginFrame` dumps and resets the histogram, so the stream shows one
/// `[MEMO-TRACE]` line per frame. Mirrors ``ReuseDenialTrace``.
/// Process-global by design (F119): this subsystem's state is `@MainActor`
/// statics keyed by per-`ViewGraph` frame IDs, so two live graphs in one
/// process would interleave counters and misattribute trace lines. Note-only
/// until multi-scene hosting is real; the fix shape is scoping to the
/// `ViewGraph` instance (or task-locals, the animation-sink storages' shape).
