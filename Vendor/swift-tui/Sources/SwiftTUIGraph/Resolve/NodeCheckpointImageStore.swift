/// F29: the persistent copy-on-write node-image store behind
/// ``ViewGraph/makeCheckpoint()``.
///
/// Before this store, every abortable frame built TWO full per-node checkpoint
/// dictionaries from scratch (baseline at frame start, prepared after resolve)
/// — the Stage-2C probe measured that O(N) build as ~99.9% of checkpoint-create
/// cost. The store keeps one live image per node and refreshes only entries
/// whose owner mutated, so a capture costs one cheap generation-compare scan
/// plus O(touched) image rebuilds, and the handout is an O(1) COW copy of the
/// persistent dictionary.
///
/// **Soundness rests on monotonic generations** (F29 slice 1): every mutation
/// of a node's checkpoint-covered state bumps its generation through the
/// stored-property observers, and restores bump rather than rewind — so
/// "generation equal ⇒ state equal" holds and an entry whose captured
/// generation matches the node's live generation is byte-faithful. The
/// restore-a-just-made-checkpoint no-op oracle in ``ViewGraph/makeCheckpoint()``
/// verifies exactly this end to end.
///
/// The store is derived cache, not graph state: it is deliberately **outside**
/// the checkpointed field groups, it is never part of a checkpoint, and every
/// ``ViewGraph/restoreCheckpoint(_:)`` resets it wholesale from the restore
/// target.
