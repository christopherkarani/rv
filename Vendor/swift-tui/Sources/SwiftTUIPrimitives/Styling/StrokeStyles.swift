/// `StrokeStyle` pairs:
/// - a ``BorderSet`` (the glyph palette. See ``BorderSet`` for details.)
/// - a ``LineJoin`` (square corners, or rounded ones where the palette has
///   them)
/// - a ``dash`` pattern and a ``dashPhase``, measured along the outline in
///   cell widths. Changing the phase moves the pattern round the outline.
///
/// A stroke is one cell wide. SwiftUI's `lineWidth: 1` is a hairline, and the
/// thinnest ink a cell can hold is a line glyph, so there is no width to set.
/// For a thick border, fill a shape and fill a smaller one inside it with
/// `inset(by:)`.
///
/// A border, a rectangle stroke and a `Divider` draw through one renderer, so
/// the same style draws the same cells on all three.
///
/// The default (``init(borderSet:lineJoin:dash:dashPhase:)`` with no arguments)
/// is a solid ``BorderSet/single`` line with square corners, which is what
/// SwiftUI's default stroke looks like. For rounded corners use ``rounded``, or
/// stroke a `RoundedRectangle`. The built-in controls ask for rounded corners
/// themselves, so they do not depend on this default.
///
/// A stroke does not change layout allocation. A view's `border` takes a
/// ``BorderPlacement``, and `.outset` there reserves cells around the content.
