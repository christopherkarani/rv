/// A type that can draw itself into a ``CanvasContext``.
///
/// Conformers implement ``draw(into:)``, which mutates the context's
/// configurable cell-space drawing grid via the context's public drawing
/// methods. ``CanvasDrawing`` supplies a drawing path in addition to the `Shape` protocol.
/// Use it for content that does not fit the shape fill and stroke model.
/// Examples include sparklines, plots, hand-drawn meters, and arbitrary curves.
///
/// Conformance requires `Sendable`, so drawings can cross isolation boundaries.
/// These boundaries occur between the view tree, layout, and rasterizer passes.
/// Conformance also requires `Equatable`.
/// Thus, canvas views with structurally identical drawings compare equal in the draw tree.
/// The renderer can reuse this work across renders. Most drawings are small value types where
/// `Equatable` is synthesized automatically, for example:
///
/// ```swift
/// struct Sparkline: CanvasDrawing, Equatable {
///   let values: [Double]
///   func draw(into context: inout CanvasContext) { ... }
/// }
/// ```
