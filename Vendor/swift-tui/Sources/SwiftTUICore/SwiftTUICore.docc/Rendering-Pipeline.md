# Rendering Pipeline

## Overview

Every SwiftTUI frame product moves through the same ordered phase products:

```text
resolve -> measure -> place -> semantics -> draw -> raster -> commit
```

`SwiftTUICore` owns those package-only products after it lowers authored
`SwiftTUIViews` values. `SwiftTUIRuntime` then presents the result to a
terminal, browser, or host-managed surface. The runtime can schedule measure,
place, semantics, draw, and raster as one fused frame-tail node. The products
retain distinct ownership and diagnostics.

This article describes the product model. For runtime scheduling, cancellation,
host handoff, and diagnostics, see the Runtime Render Pipeline article in the
`SwiftTUIRuntime` documentation.

## Runtime Mapping

Interactive sessions drive the phase products through runtime stages:

```text
head -> animationInjection -> latePreferenceReconciliation -> fusedFrameTail -> commit
```

The runtime stages are scheduling boundaries, not new frame products.
`resolve` happens while building the frame head. `measure`, `place`,
`semantics`, `draw`, and `raster` usually run in the fused frame tail. `commit`
publishes the resulting frame products plus lifecycle and handler effects.

The direct `DefaultRenderer.render` snapshot path exposes a public
`RenderSnapshot`. Package internals and the interactive run-loop path use
`FrameArtifacts`. The interactive path adds invalidation coalescing, frame-tail
cancellation, completed-frame disposition, host-facing presentation damage, and
presentation to a concrete surface.

## Phase Roles

### Resolve

Produces `ResolvedNode` trees with the resolved identity projection,
`StructuralPath`, optional `EntityIdentity`, state ownership, merged
environment, view metadata, and runtime registrations.

### Measure

Calculates subtree sizes under proposals through `LayoutEngine`.

### Place

Turns measured trees into final integer-cell geometry, which becomes the
authoritative source for interaction regions and content bounds.

### Semantics

Extracts focus, interaction, action, selection, scroll, named coordinate-space,
and pointer routing into `SemanticSnapshot`.

### Draw

Lowers geometry plus metadata into draw commands and collection chrome.

### Raster

Converts draw commands into `RasterSurface`, a cell grid with styles,
attachments, image attachments, continuation-cell handling, and a package-level
ordered presentation-layer sidecar. The final cell grid plus image attachments
remain the compatibility boundary for hosts. The sidecar records compact cell
fragments and image attachment paint events in raster order. Package tests and
future host replay paths can inspect this authoring order without replacing the
collapsed surface.

Image attachments remain host presentation records. If an image has an active
blend mode, the raster phase records its visible backdrop metadata. This
metadata includes cell backgrounds, explicit foreground colors, glyphs, and
continuation spans. The runtime uses this metadata to precompose a blended
image variant without changing the cell-grid model.

### Commit

Packages lifecycle and handler-installation work into `CommitPlan`.

## Why The Split Matters

Keeping the phases explicit means layout and semantics do not need terminal
escape-sequence knowledge, and runtime presentation can evolve without
rewriting layout.

Layout products are integer-cell based. Pointer and Canvas APIs can still carry
continuous `Point` values. The runtime normalizes pointer input after semantic
routing. Canvas packs continuous cell-space samples during raster.

Later phases can carry named snapshots of earlier data, but those snapshots are
not independent owners. `PlacedNodeResolvedMetadata` names the resolved
metadata mirrored into placed nodes. `SemanticSnapshot` is a derived routing
product. `DrawNode` is a placed-to-paint projection. `RasterSurface` owns the
final cell grid, raster attachments, and package-level presentation-order
sidecar.
Retained layout reuse must pair any relaxed equivalence predicate with a refresh
path before downstream phases read the reused product.

## Performance Shape

Steady-state performance depends on how much work each phase can avoid:

- Resolve must scale with the dirty frontier plus retained-reuse bookkeeping
  after the initial frame.
- Layout and placement are tree/layout dependent, and eligible frame-tail work
  can run away from the main actor.
- Semantics and draw walk the effective placed tree.
- Raster can reuse the previous renderer-committed surface when damage is
  sound.
- Commit stays on the main actor and must publish only the changed runtime
  registration scope on narrow updates.

The runtime re-derives host-facing damage against the last frame actually
presented to that host. Renderer-private raster reuse hints are never a
frontend contract.
