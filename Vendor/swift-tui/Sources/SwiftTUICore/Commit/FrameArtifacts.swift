/// when storing these artifacts for a later frame.
///
/// Field authority:
///
/// - Canonical phase products: ``resolvedTree``, ``measuredTree``,
///   ``semanticSnapshot``, ``drawTree``, and ``rasterSurface``.
/// - Decorated/baseline-sensitive projection: ``placedTree``. A current frame
///   may commit an animation-decorated placed tree, but retained-layout
///   baselines must store the canonical placement product.
/// - Renderer artifact raster damage: ``presentationDamage``.
/// - Advisory visibility signals: ``drawnIdentities``.
/// - Side-effect plan: ``commitPlan``.
/// - Diagnostics: ``diagnostics``.
