# All Guides

Every developer guide in the published documentation, organized by task.

## Overview

The reference documentation is organized by module; the guides below are the
task-oriented spine across it. Because each guide ships in the catalog of the
module that owns its subject, the links here cross module boundaries and use
the published site URLs. The website collects the same spine, with the
site-hosted primers, at [swifttui.sh/guides](https://swifttui.sh/guides/).

### Your first hour

Read these in order the first time through:

1. <doc:Choosing-Modules-And-Platforms> — one dependency and one import for
   most apps, plus the product matrix when you need a narrower build.
2. [Authoring Views](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/authoring-views)
   — containers, local state, focused controls, and modifiers around a
   body-driven tree.
3. [State, Environment, and Focus](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/state-environment-and-focus)
   — state, observation, environment, and focus on one runtime invalidation
   path.
4. [Running Apps](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiruntime/running-apps)
   — runtime entry points from the `@main` convenience down to hosted scene
   sessions.
5. [Coming from SwiftUI](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/coming-from-swiftui)
   — what transfers unchanged, which reflexes need retraining, and what is not
   here yet.

### Building your interface

These guides ship in the `SwiftTUIViews` catalog, the authoring surface that
every app product re-exports.

- [Forms and Controls](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/forms-and-controls)
  — buttons, toggles, pickers, sliders, steppers, and text entry, built into
  a working form.
- [Commands and Key Input](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/commands-and-key-input)
  — `keyCommand` chords, the command palette, `onKeyPress`, directional and
  Escape commands, and submit handling.
- [Understanding Focus](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/focus)
  — the runtime focus model for input routing, state control, and context
  export.
- [Navigation and Tabs](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/navigation-and-tabs)
  — `NavigationStack` push/pop with typed paths, destinations, and `TabView`
  authoring.
- [Scrolling](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/scrolling)
  — viewport sizing, compositional lazy stacks, nested wheel routing,
  programmatic scrolling, positions, and indicators.
- [The Style System](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/style-system)
  — all 28 open style families in one place: built-ins, scoping, custom
  conformances, route wrappers, theming, diagnostics, and tests.
- [Styling and Theming](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/styling-and-theming)
  — semantic roles, colors, gradients, the theme model, and your first
  custom style.
- [Authoring Styles](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/authoring-styles)
  — the contract every family shares: body-producing and presentation-value
  styles, route wrappers, and what a style may change.
- [Testing Styles](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/testing-styles)
  — unit-test a style without a live render through the fixture SPI.
- [Animating Views](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/animating-views)
  — implicit and explicit animation, transitions, phase animators, and
  timelines in terminal cells.
- [Lists and Tables](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/collections)
  — collections with authored row content, selection, and viewport-backed
  data sources.
- [Geometry and Preferences](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/geometry-and-preferences)
  — anchor preferences that publish subtree geometry for post-layout
  resolution.
- [Shapes](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/shapes) —
  arcs, fills, strokes, shape clipping, and compatible-path animation on the
  terminal grid.
- [Animated images](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuianimatedimage)
  — GIF decoding and encoding, frame timing, finite loop counts, and reduced motion.
- [Aspect-correct shapes in terminals](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/aspectcorrectshapes)
  — cell pixel metrics keep circles circular across terminal fonts.
- [Pointer and Canvas Coordinates](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/pointer-and-canvas)
  — one continuous cell coordinate space for gestures, hover, and drawing.
- [Accessibility](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/accessibility)
  — semantic metadata for terminal screen readers, browser ARIA trees,
  VoiceOver, and TalkBack.
- [Custom Dynamic Properties](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/custom-dynamic-properties)
  — property wrappers built on the `DynamicProperty` extension point.
- [State Keying](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/state-keying)
  — how `@State` storage is keyed across evaluations, and where owners
  survive lazy seams.
- [Dormant Tab State](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/dormant-tab-state)
  — what happens to a tab's persistent state while the tab is not selected.
- [Dismissal Is Data](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/dismissal-is-data)
  — presentations driven by Boolean bindings and identifiable items.

### Charts

- [Getting Started with SwiftTUICharts](https://swifttui.sh/docs/charts/documentation/swifttuicharts/getting-started)
  — install the package, add your first chart, and migrate from the
  in-framework module.
- [Building Dashboards](https://swifttui.sh/docs/charts/documentation/swifttuicharts/building-dashboards)
  — the `SwiftTUICharts` guide, from the separate
  [`swift-tui-charts`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-charts) package.

### Running your app

These guides ship in this catalog and in the `SwiftTUIRuntime` and platform
catalogs.

- <doc:Testing-Your-App> — one-shot frames with `RenderOnce`, renderer
  snapshots, deterministic CI output, and the test-support product.
- <doc:Distributing-Your-App> — release builds, the flags every binary
  ships, shell completions, and platform packaging notes.
- [Performance for App Authors](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiruntime/performance-for-app-authors)
  — what is already fast, `.equatable()` memoization, stable identity, lazy
  containers, and the profiling loop.
- [Logging and Diagnostics](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiruntime/logging-and-diagnostics)
  — where `print()` goes while the app owns the screen, debug bundles,
  runtime issues, and safe logging patterns.
- [Command-Line Options and Subcommands](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiarguments)
  — the standard `SwiftTUIOptions` flag surface, custom app flags, and verb
  routing under a positional root.
- [Profiling](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiprofiling)
  — opt-in frame and present instrumentation with TSV sinks.
- [Terminal Embedding](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiruntime/terminalembedding)
  — hosting external terminal programs inside SwiftTUI layout.
- [Terminal Handoffs](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiruntime/terminal-handoffs)
  — temporarily returning the interactive terminal to the user's shell.
- [Environment Variables](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiruntime/environment-variables)
  — every `SWIFTTUI_*` variable the framework reads.

### Beyond the terminal

The same authored `App`, on other hosts.

- [Adapting an Interface to Its Host](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiviews/adapting-to-hosts)
  — share state and views while adapting touch targets, keyboard access,
  navigation, scrolling, and accessibility to the host.
- [Deploying to the Browser](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiwasi/deploying-to-the-browser)
  — `--web` for localhost, or a static WASI bundle packaged with
  [`@swifttui/build`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-web) and mounted
  with `@swifttui/web`.
- [Hosts and Platforms](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiruntime/hosts-and-platforms)
  — the host and distribution matrix: terminal, browser, Android, and native
  SwiftUI embedding.
- [Embedding in a SwiftUI App](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-swiftui#readme)
  — the native macOS/iOS host from the
  [`swift-tui-swiftui`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-swiftui)
  package; its DocC ships with that package.
- [Hosting on Android](https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/swifttuiandroidhost/hosting-on-android)
  — the Gradle plugin and Compose host, with the Kotlin-side reference in
  [`swift-tui-android`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-android).
