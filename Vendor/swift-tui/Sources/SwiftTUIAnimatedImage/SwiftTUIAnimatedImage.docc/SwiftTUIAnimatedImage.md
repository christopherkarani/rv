# ``SwiftTUIAnimatedImage``

Animate finite pre-composed image sequences and import or export GIFs.

## Overview

`SwiftTUIAnimatedImage` ships inside the batteries-included `SwiftTUI`
product — `import SwiftTUI` re-exports it — and is also available as a
standalone SwiftPM library product for narrower compositions. It keeps GIF
decoding and animated playback out of the core runtime while rendering
through the same `SwiftTUIViews` surface as static images. `Image(data:)`
never decodes GIF containers itself; to animate a GIF, decode it with
``AnimatedGIF`` and display the result with ``AnimatedImage``.

## Loading and playing a GIF

``AnimatedGIF`` turns GIF container bytes into an ``AnimatedImageSequence``
— fully composited RGBA frames plus one display delay per frame — and
``AnimatedImage`` plays that sequence as a view:

```swift
let animation = try AnimatedGIF.decode(contentsOf: "nyan.gif")
// or, with the container bytes already in memory:
// let animation = try AnimatedGIF.decode(data: gifBytes)

struct GIFPlayer: View {
  let animation: AnimatedImageSequence

  var body: some View {
    AnimatedImage(animation)
  }
}
```

The throwing initializers `AnimatedImage(gifData:)` and
`AnimatedImage(gifContentsOf:)` collapse the decode step when you do not
need the sequence value itself. Decoding normalizes GIF timing: a zero
delay becomes 100 ms, and all delays are floored at 20 ms.

## Playback

A sequence with more than one frame starts playing when the view appears,
waiting each frame's own delay before advancing;
the playback task is cancelled with the view. Changing the view's sequence
value restarts playback from the first frame. A single-frame sequence
renders as a static image with no playback task. The test suite drives a
real run loop and asserts that every GIF-decoded frame is presented and
that a two-frame round trip preserves distinct 50 ms and 120 ms delays.

`AnimatedImageSequence.loopCount` preserves GIF's optional repeat metadata:
`nil` means no loop extension and one play; `0` repeats indefinitely; a
positive value repeats that many times **after the first play**. A value of
`1` therefore plays twice. Finite playback waits the last frame's delay and
then leaves that frame visible without scheduling another tick.
Frame-based initializers default to `0`; their `loopCount:` overloads
accept `nil` or any integer in `0...65535`. The count participates in sequence
equality, hashing and playback task identity.

| `loopCount` | Total plays | When playback ends |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nil` | One | Hold the last frame |
| `0` | Unbounded | Continue until removal or a playback-policy change |
| `1` | Two | Hold the last frame |
| `n > 0` | `n + 1` | Hold the last frame |

An editor that asks for a total play count should translate that value to GIF
repeat metadata at its boundary, rather than treating repeats as total plays.

Each frame reaches the renderer as PNG bytes through the same
`Image(data:)` surface as static images — encoded once per frame and
cached — so modifiers such as `.blendMode(...)` composite the current
frame exactly as they would a static image.

## Authoring frames in code

Frames are plain values: an ``AnimatedImageFrame`` is a pixel size plus a
row-major array of 8-bit RGBA ``AnimatedImagePixel`` values. All frames in
one sequence must share the same pixel size. Provide timing as a uniform
frame rate or as one explicit delay per frame:

```swift
let red = AnimatedImageFrame(
  width: 1,
  height: 1,
  pixels: [AnimatedImagePixel(red: 255, green: 0, blue: 0)]
)
let blue = AnimatedImageFrame(
  width: 1,
  height: 1,
  pixels: [AnimatedImagePixel(red: 0, green: 0, blue: 255)]
)

AnimatedImage(frames: [red, blue], framesPerSecond: 12)
AnimatedImage(
  frames: [red, blue],
  frameDelays: [.milliseconds(80), .milliseconds(120)]
)
```

## Exporting a GIF

``AnimatedGIF`` also encodes a sequence back into GIF file bytes, preserving
its `loopCount` metadata. Newly authored sequences default to infinite repeats:

```swift
let sequence = AnimatedImageSequence(
  frames: [red, blue],
  frameDelays: [.milliseconds(50), .milliseconds(120)]
)
let gifBytes = try AnimatedGIF.encode(sequence)
```

Use `AnimatedGIF.encode(sequence, loopCount: 2)` to override the exported
repeat count, or `loopCount: nil` to omit the loop extension. Decode/encode
round trips preserve absent, infinite and finite counts, even for one frame.

The encoder builds a palette of up to 256 distinct colors and snaps any
extra colors to the nearest palette entry. Fully transparent pixels stay
transparent; partial alpha becomes opaque. Delays round up to whole
centiseconds, the GIF container's resolution, so centisecond-precision
delays — and every frame's pixels — survive an encode/decode round trip
exactly.

## Reduced motion and stable output

Under reduced motion — the `--reduce-motion` flag,
`SWIFTTUI_REDUCE_MOTION=1`, or the `--accessible` /
`SWIFTTUI_ACCESSIBLE=1` alias — ``AnimatedImage`` renders only the first
frame and starts no playback task. Stable-output capture (CI, a non-TTY
stdout, or `SWIFTTUI_STABLE_OUTPUT=1`) pins the first frame the same way
without reporting a reduced-motion preference to app code through
`accessibilityReduceMotion`. Tests assert both: the first frame is the
rendered attachment and the task registry stays empty.
