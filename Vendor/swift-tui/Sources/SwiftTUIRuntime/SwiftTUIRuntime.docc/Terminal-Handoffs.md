# Terminal Handoffs

Temporarily return an interactive terminal to the user's shell while an
asynchronous operation runs.

## Overview

An interactive SwiftTUI session owns terminal input, raw mode, and the
alternate screen. Launching an operation that expects a normal terminal while
that ownership remains active causes the operation and SwiftTUI to compete for
input and presentation.

Use `TerminalHandoffAction` to transfer that ownership as one operation:

```swift
struct ShellButton: View {
  @Environment(\.terminalHandoff) private var terminalHandoff

  var body: some View {
    Button("Open shell") {
      Task {
        try await terminalHandoff {
          try await launchInteractiveShell()
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The runtime performs this sequence:

1. Suspends the live input reader and waits for any in-flight read to finish.
2. Leaves raw mode and the alternate screen.
3. Awaits the operation.
4. Re-enters raw mode and the alternate screen.
5. Re-synchronizes input capabilities and schedules a full redraw.
6. Resumes the input reader.

The restoration path runs when the operation succeeds, throws, or
cooperatively observes task cancellation. If terminal ownership cannot be
reclaimed, the action throws
`TerminalHandoffError.failedToRestoreTerminal`.

An unstructured task can outlive the run loop that created it. An operation can
finish after its terminal session shuts down. In that case, the action throws
`TerminalHandoffError.unavailable`. It does not re-enter raw mode or the
alternate screen.

The WASI ANSI runner suspends its stdin poller through the same acknowledged
read barrier used for Windows polling input. Suspension waits for an in-flight
read to finish before the operation begins. The host must provide the external
operation; this API does not add subprocess support to WASI. Surface-only hosts
without terminal mode control continue to report `TerminalHandoffError.unavailable`.

## Model-Owned Dependencies

A model is often created before a view can read an environment value. In that
case, make the dependency call the task-local static entry point:

```swift
let openShell: @MainActor @Sendable () async throws -> Void = {
  try await TerminalHandoffAction.perform {
    try await launchInteractiveShell()
  }
}
```

The current action is scoped to the task running a terminal scene. Structured
child tasks inherit it, while detached tasks and calls outside a live terminal
session throw `TerminalHandoffError.unavailable`. This avoids a
process-global "current terminal" that can route one scene's operation
through another scene's run loop.

Only one handoff can run in a terminal session at a time. A concurrent request
throws `TerminalHandoffError.alreadyInProgress`.

The API surface — `TerminalHandoffAction`, `TerminalHandoffError`, and the
`terminalHandoff` environment value — is declared in the authoring surface
that every app product re-exports; its per-symbol reference lives in the
`SwiftTUIViews` module.
