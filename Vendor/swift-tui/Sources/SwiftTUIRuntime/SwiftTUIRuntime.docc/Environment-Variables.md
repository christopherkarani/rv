# Environment Variables

Every `SWIFTTUI_*` environment variable the framework reads, grouped by
subsystem.

## Overview

SwiftTUI reads its process environment in a small number of well-defined
places: the runtime configuration resolver, the run loop's render-mode
selector, the resolve-engine profile, a central feature-gate registry, the
diagnostic trace sinks, and the platform runners. This page lists every
variable each of those owners reads, what values it accepts, and what it
changes.

### Reading rules

Unless a row says otherwise, boolean variables share one grammar: **unset**
keeps the default, **empty or `0`** means off, and **any other value** means
on. Integer and path variables state their shape in their row.

Most gates read the environment **once** and latch the result, so set variables
before the process launches. Command-line flags parsed by `SwiftTUICommand`
(`SwiftTUIArguments`) layer on top of the environment result, so an explicit
flag wins over an inherited variable.

SwiftTUI also honors the standard terminal conventions (`NO_COLOR`,
`FORCE_COLOR`, `CLICOLOR`, `CLICOLOR_FORCE`, `CI`, `TERM`, `COLORTERM`, and
`LANG`/`LC_*`) through ``TerminalCapabilityProfile`` and the runtime
configuration resolver. `NO_COLOR` always wins over `FORCE_COLOR`.

Beyond that family, the framework consults these standard variables:

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `COLORFGBG` | Selects the light/dark terminal appearance when the terminal reports its palette this way, which changes the resolved theme. |
| `TERM_PROGRAM` | Drives the sub-cell pointer-precision compatibility matrix (`xterm.js`, `foot`, `kitty`, `wezterm`, `iTerm.app`, …). |
| `LC_TERMINAL` | iTerm2's terminal identifier; consulted alongside `TERM_PROGRAM` for pointer precision. |
| `TMUX` | Suppresses pixel-mouse probing inside tmux (the kitty-keyboard probe is also skipped there). |
| `HOME` | The install location for `SwiftTUIArguments` completion scripts; installation fails when it is empty. |

### Output and presentation

Read by `RuntimeConfiguration.detect(environment:isStdoutTTY:)` at session
start.

| Variable | Values | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SWIFTTUI_ACCESSIBLE` | boolean | Shorthand for `SWIFTTUI_REDUCE_MOTION=1` plus `SWIFTTUI_CURSOR_FOLLOWS_FOCUS=1`. Wins over explicit `0` values on those two variables. |
| `SWIFTTUI_JSON` | boolean | Selects JSON output. |
| `SWIFTTUI_ASCII` | boolean | Forces ASCII glyphs in place of Unicode box drawing and symbols. |
| `SWIFTTUI_REDUCE_MOTION` | `0` / truthy | Truthy sets the app-visible accessibility reduce-motion preference and renders built-in animation in its static form. |
| `SWIFTTUI_STABLE_OUTPUT` | `0` / truthy | Explicitly disables built-in animation for deterministic capture without changing the accessibility preference. When unset, `CI=true` or a non-TTY stdout enables stable output automatically. |
| `SWIFTTUI_DEBUG` | boolean | Debug mode: arms the session debug bundle (see *Debug bundles and trace selection*), including the diagnostics TSV and the frame trace. |
| `SWIFTTUI_CURSOR_FOLLOWS_FOCUS` | boolean | Moves the hardware terminal cursor to the focused control so screen readers can track focus. |

### Web host session

Also read by `RuntimeConfiguration.detect`. The group is consulted only when
`SWIFTTUI_WEB` is truthy; it makes the batteries-included runner serve the app
to a browser instead of (or alongside) the terminal.

| Variable | Values | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SWIFTTUI_WEB` | boolean | Enables the web host session. |
| `SWIFTTUI_PORT` | integer, default `0` | Listen port. `0` picks an ephemeral port. |
| `SWIFTTUI_BIND` | address, default `127.0.0.1` | Listen address. |
| `SWIFTTUI_OPEN` | boolean | Requests opening the served URL in a browser. |
| `SWIFTTUI_NO_OPEN` | boolean | Vetoes `SWIFTTUI_OPEN`. |
| `SWIFTTUI_WEB_SCENE` | ``WindowIdentifier`` string | Selects which scene the web session hosts. |

### Terminal capabilities

| Variable | Values | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SWIFTTUI_KITTY_KEYBOARD` | `0` opts out | The host probes for the kitty keyboard protocol and enables its disambiguation flag when supported. Only the exact value `0` disables the probe. The probe is also skipped inside tmux/screen and on non-TTY descriptors. |

### Render pipeline

| Variable | Values | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SWIFTTUI_RENDER_MODE` | `sync`, `async` (default), `async-no-cancel`, `async-no-drop` | Initial value of ``RunLoop/renderMode``, which selects the interactive pipeline documented in <doc:Runtime-Render-Pipeline>. Unrecognized values fall back to `async`. |
| `SWIFTTUI_MERGE_PRESSURE_PACING` | boolean, default off | Enables adaptive spacing between invalidation-only frames under recent merge pressure. The gap follows measured frame cost and is capped at 50 ms. Input (including wheel-driven changes), signals, external wakes, and due deadlines bypass it. |

- `sync`: the one-shot synchronous pipeline. The entire fused frame tail
  (layout, semantics, draw, raster) runs on the main actor with no worker
  offload and no cancellation machinery.
- `async`: the cancellable pipeline. The frame tail may run on the layout
  worker; a queued tail can be cancelled before start when newer input
  intent arrives, and a completed frame can be dropped when superseded
  (bounded by the drop-eligibility blockers).
- `async-no-cancel`: never cancels a queued tail and commits completed
  frames in order. Browser-hosted sessions use this mode for presentation
  cadence.
- `async-no-drop`: keeps pre-start cancellation but never drops a
  completed frame.

Even in the async modes, per-frame offload eligibility is automatic: a tree
containing main-actor-only custom layouts, main-actor-only indexed child
sources, or layout-realized content runs its tail on the main actor for that
frame. There is no variable for that fallback; `sync` is the switch that
guarantees fully main-actor execution.

### Resolve-engine profile

The stack-lean profile trades resolve-pass conveniences for shallow call
stacks. It exists for WASI browser hosts, where worker threads get a small
fraction of the main thread's native stack, and for Windows, where a
default-linked executable reserves only 1 MiB of main-thread stack (POSIX
mains get 8 MiB).

| Variable | Values | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SWIFTTUI_STACK_LEAN_PROFILE` | exactly `0` or `1` | The stack-lean resolve profile: lean ambient slots instead of task-locals, reuse/memo/selective evaluation off; shares iterative descent with the full profile. Defaults on for WASI builds. On Windows it arms automatically when the measured main-thread stack reserve is below the 8 MiB full-engine floor (link with `-Xlinker /STACK:16777216` to run the full engine); an explicit value overrides that automatic choice, and a debug build that degrades emits a `windows.stack-floor-lean-profile` runtime issue. Otherwise off natively. Other values are ignored. |
| `SWIFTTUI_LEAN_RETAINED_REUSE` | exactly `1` | Re-enables retained reuse under the lean profile (a reuse hit shortens the descent, so it can only shallow the stack). Ignored when the lean profile is off. |

### Soundness and verification gates

These gates are enrolled in the framework's central `FeatureGate` registry and
share the standard boolean grammar.

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SWIFTTUI_SOUNDNESS_PROBE` | on | The reconciliation soundness probe: read-only oracles (stamp coherence, checkpoint equality, teardown coherence, …) run on sampled frames in release and every frame in debug. `0` opts out. |
| `SWIFTTUI_SOUNDNESS_PROBE_SAMPLE` | `256` release, `1` debug | Runs the oracles on 1-in-*N* frames. Driven by the frame counter, so sampling is deterministic. |
| `SWIFTTUI_SOUNDNESS_PROBE_TRACE` | off | Emits one `[SOUNDNESS]` line per recorded violation. Also armable via `SWIFTTUI_TRACE=soundness`. |
| `SWIFTTUI_ANIMATION_VELOCITY` | on | The animation velocity channel: a built-in spring retargeted mid-flight carries the outgoing curve's velocity, and writes made under `Transaction.tracksVelocity` seed the next spring on the same value. `0` restores the at-rest restart wholesale (one-release kill switch). |
| `SWIFTTUI_STATE_CAPTURE_BINDING` | on | Binds `@State` ownership into the view copies that body evaluation captures, so imperative closures resolve state through their carried owner. `0` disables the bind pass as a diagnostic A/B lever; it does not restore the earlier ambient-dispatch behavior. |
| `SWIFTTUI_SOUNDNESS_PROBE_TRACE_FILE` | stderr | Path that receives the soundness trace lines instead of the debug bundle's `soundness.log` or stderr. |
| `SWIFTTUI_RASTER_VERIFY_INCREMENTAL` | debug on, release off | Forces the incremental-raster verification policy: re-rasters fresh and compares byte-for-byte, recording any mismatch. |
| `SWIFTTUI_RASTER_TRUST_SOUND_DAMAGE` | release on, debug off | Forces the trusting policy: incremental damage is applied without the fresh-raster comparison. When both raster variables are set, verify wins. |
| `SWIFTTUI_OVERLAY_INCREMENTAL_DAMAGE` | off | Opt-in prototype: bounded damage for additive presentation overlays instead of a full-surface re-raster on topology change. Validate runs with `SWIFTTUI_RASTER_VERIFY_INCREMENTAL=1`. |
| `SWIFTTUI_PRESENTED_PROGRESS_GUARD` | off | Opt-in insurance: a completed frame whose presentation diff is non-empty is never drop-eligible, so undelivered pixels cannot be coalesced away. |
| `SWIFTTUI_COLLECTION_PROBES` | debug on, release off | Arms the collection magnitude counters (realized rows, list layout derivations) so release timings can be correlated with realization counts. |

### Debug bundles and trace selection

The debug bundle is the one-stop capture path: one directory that collects
every armed diagnostic under a fixed name, plus a `manifest.txt` recording
what was armed. `SWIFTTUI_DEBUG=1` (or `--debug`) with no explicit directory
installs a default bundle under `$TMPDIR` and the terminal CLI runner prints
`SwiftTUI debug bundle: <dir>` to stderr after the session ends.

```bash
SWIFTTUI_DEBUG=1 SWIFTTUI_DEBUG_DIR=/tmp/myapp-debug myapp
```

| Variable | Values | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SWIFTTUI_DEBUG_DIR` | directory path | The bundle directory. Every diagnostic stream without an explicit `*_FILE` override writes here under its fixed name: `frames.tsv`, `diagnostics.tsv`, `memo.log`, `reuse.log`, `inval.log`, `soundness.log`, `profile.tsv`/`profile.jsonl`, `runtime-issues.log`, `manifest.txt`. Created on first use; unavailable on WASI. `runtime-issues.log` receives runtime issues reported while the terminal session owns the screen; without a bundle those issues are held and flushed to stderr after the session ends. |
| `SWIFTTUI_TRACE` | `trace *("," trace)` with `trace = name["@" sampleN]` | Arms diagnostic-trace emission by name: `frames`, `memo`, `reuse`, `inval`, `soundness`, `publication`. `@N` sets the owning oracle's 1-in-*N* sampling (`memo`, `soundness`). Example: `SWIFTTUI_TRACE=memo@256,reuse,frames`. Malformed input fails closed; unknown names are ignored. |

The per-trace variable triplets below keep working and win over the bundle
for their stream, but `SWIFTTUI_TRACE` + `SWIFTTUI_DEBUG_DIR` is the
preferred spelling.

### Diagnostics and tracing

| Variable | Values | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SWIFTTUI_PROFILE` | grammar | Activates the opt-in `SwiftTUIProfiling` product on scenes that add `.profiling()`: `signal-list[;sink-list]` with signals `frames`, `memory[@duration]`, `cpu[@duration]` and sinks `tsv[=path]`, `jsonl[=path]`, `summary`. Bare `tsv`/`jsonl` write `profile.tsv`/`profile.jsonl` into the debug bundle. See the `SwiftTUIProfiling` DocC catalog for the full grammar. |
| `SWIFTTUI_FRAME_TRACE` | file path | Installs the per-frame TSV trace sink (`COMMIT`, `ZEROART`, and `ELIDE` rows with causes, tail state, animation counts, and drop decisions). `SWIFTTUI_TRACE=frames` (or `SWIFTTUI_DEBUG=1`) writes the bundle's `frames.tsv` instead. Unavailable on WASI. |
| `SWIFTTUI_MEMO_TRACE` | boolean, default on | The memoization soundness oracle, sampled 1-in-256 in release and every frame in debug. `0` disables the oracle; a truthy value additionally emits one `[MEMO-TRACE]` line per frame (also armable via `SWIFTTUI_TRACE=memo`). |
| `SWIFTTUI_MEMO_TRACE_FILE` | file path | Appends `[MEMO-TRACE]` lines to a file (and enables emission) instead of the bundle's `memo.log` or stderr. |
| `SWIFTTUI_MEMO_TRACE_SAMPLE` | integer | Overrides the memo oracle's 1-in-*N* frame sampling (or use `SWIFTTUI_TRACE=memo@N`). |
| `SWIFTTUI_REUSE_TRACE` | boolean, default off | Per-frame `[REUSE-TRACE]` histogram of why retained reuse was denied per node (dirty, env-mismatch, suppressed, …). Also armable via `SWIFTTUI_TRACE=reuse`. |
| `SWIFTTUI_REUSE_TRACE_FILE` | file path | Appends reuse-trace lines to a file instead of the bundle's `reuse.log` or stderr. |
| `SWIFTTUI_INVAL_TRACE` | boolean, default off | Per-frame `[INVAL-TRACE]` line decomposing how the invalidation set was assembled (raw scheduler set, portal translation, force-root reasons). Also armable via `SWIFTTUI_TRACE=inval`. |
| `SWIFTTUI_INVAL_TRACE_FILE` | file path | Appends invalidation-trace lines to a file instead of the bundle's `inval.log` or stderr. |
| `SWIFTTUI_PUBLICATION_DIAGNOSTICS` | boolean | Enables runtime registration-publication diagnostics (checkpoint and portal bookkeeping counters). Also armable via `SWIFTTUI_TRACE=publication`. |
| `SWIFTTUI_RETAINED_VALIDATION_COUNTERS` | boolean, default off | Records comparison, identity-validation, and metadata-restamping work during retained layout. Enable when profiling cache-validation cost; it adds diagnostic work and does not change reuse policy. |
| `SWIFTTUI_DIAGNOSTICS` | boolean or file path | Terminal CLI runner: `1`/`true` writes the diagnostics TSV to the bundle's `diagnostics.tsv` (or `/tmp/termui-diagnostics.tsv` with no bundle); any other truthy value is used as the file path. `SWIFTTUI_DEBUG=1` (or `--debug`) implies the same resolution. |

### Browser (WASI) host

Read by the WASI runner. The browser bridge sets most of these; they are
listed for completeness and for driving the wasm binary directly.

| Variable | Values | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SWIFTTUI_TRANSPORT` | `ansi`, `terminal`, `xterm`, `ghostty-web`; default surface | Selects the ANSI terminal transport instead of the structured surface transport. |
| `SWIFTTUI_SURFACE_DELTA` | `1`/`true`/`yes`/`on` | Declares that the host accepts delta frames on the surface transport (the browser bridge's capability opt-in). |
| `SWIFTTUI_FRAME_DIAGNOSTICS` | boolean | Enables wire frame diagnostics. Falls back to `SWIFTTUI_DIAGNOSTICS`; `off`/`false`/`none`/`0`/empty disable. |
| `SWIFTTUI_MODE` | `manifest` | Prints the app's scene manifest as JSON and exits without launching a scene. |
| `SWIFTTUI_SCENE` | scene selector | Selects the scene to launch. Falls back to the first command-line argument. |
| `SWIFTTUI_RENDER_STYLE` | base64 | A base64-encoded terminal render style forwarded by the host. |
| `SWIFTTUI_COLUMNS` / `SWIFTTUI_ROWS` | integers | Surface size fallbacks, consulted after the standard `COLUMNS`/`LINES`. Clamped to at least 40×20; defaults 120×36. |

### Repository tooling

Some variables with the `SWIFTTUI_` prefix are read only by the test and gate
tooling: timeout scaling, fixture regeneration, serialized test execution, and
similar. They are contributor-facing and documented in the coordination
repository's maintainer docs (`swift-tui-org/docs/swift-tui/DEVELOPMENT.md`
and `swift-tui-org/docs/swift-tui/KNOWN-TEST-FLAKES.md`), not here.

`SWIFTTUI_ASSERT_ITERATIVE_RESOLVE=1` enables a development assertion that rejects
a synchronous resolver drain nested inside another drain. It detects internal
child paths that bypass the continuation protocol. It also rejects explicit
authored renderer re-entry, so it is intended for framework validation.
