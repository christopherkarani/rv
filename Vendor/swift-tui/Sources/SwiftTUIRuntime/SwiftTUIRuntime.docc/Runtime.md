# Runtime Behavior

The lifecycle, state, observation, input, and incremental delivery models.

## Overview

This article is the stable reference for ``RunLoop`` and the surrounding
runtime. It starts after the runtime resolves authored `View`, ``Scene``, and
``App`` values into frame artifacts.

## Runtime Shape

The runtime presents one committed frame at a time through the same strict pipeline used everywhere else:

```text
resolve -> measure -> place -> semantics -> draw -> raster -> commit
```

``RunLoop`` integrates terminal I/O, invalidation scheduling, input, signals, lifecycle staging, and task reconciliation around that pure frame pipeline.

For interactive sessions, the runtime owns the terminal alternate-screen buffer while running. That gives each ``WindowGroup`` a clean full-canvas presentation surface and restores the previous shell buffer on exit.

For the underlying phase products and runtime scheduling, see
<doc:Runtime-Render-Pipeline>.

## Root-Hoisted Presentations

Built-in presentations (`alert`, `confirmationDialog`, `sheet`, `popover`,
`popoverTip`, menus, and `toast`) are authored inside the base view tree but
displayed through root-level composition.

- Base resolution collects presentation declarations during the ordinary
  resolve pass.
- Portal roots reconcile those declarations. Then they compose visible overlay
  payloads around the resolved base tree.
- Presentation hosts derive visible overlay state from the current resolved
  base declarations before overlay composition. Wrapper-hosted and selectively
  re-evaluated subtrees do not wait for an outer host rerender. An existing
  declaration appears immediately.
- Each active sheet, full-screen cover, popover, and menu produces its own
  stable overlay entry. Later activations compose above earlier activations
  without unmounting the covered entry.
- Alerts and confirmation dialogs expose only their oldest active entry and
  advance in first-in, first-out order. Toasts remain one aggregate entry.
- Escape and other stack-wide dismissal routes consider visible entries only,
  then select the most recently activated entry across presentation families.
- The renderer composes the base root and overlay stack for downstream measure,
  place, semantics, draw, raster, and commit work.
- Opening or dismissing a presentation does not re-resolve the displayed base
  subtree under a synthetic identity path. Presentation churn does not affect
  the selected tab or child owner. A presentation action can still select
  different content through a state change.
- Dismissing a presentation prunes only its overlay-owned subtree identities.
  It must not remove unrelated retained content.
- Modal overlays can still suppress base interaction through the composed
  frame's semantic state.

## Input, Focus, And Interaction

The runtime is keyboard-first, but it is not keyboard-only.

- Keyboard input is parsed into `KeyEvent` and `InputEvent` values.
- On terminals that support the kitty keyboard protocol, the host enables its disambiguation flag automatically (opt out with `SWIFTTUI_KITTY_KEYBOARD=0`), so keys the legacy byte encoding conflates (Escape vs. Alt-prefixed keys, Ctrl+J vs. Enter, Ctrl+I vs. Tab) arrive as distinct events
- Terminals that advertise mouse reporting feed pointer events into the same
  semantic routing layer.
- Focus routing remains the authoritative target-selection system for keyboard
  interaction.
- Pointer interaction augments authored controls and collections. It does not
  replace the focus model.

Control activation, selection changes, scrolling, and editing use the same
semantic and lifecycle system. This rule applies to keyboard events and events
from the mouse-reporting stream.

Pointer input is normalized into `PointerLocation` before dispatch. Semantic
routing uses the containing integer cell, while gestures, hover handlers, and
spatial drop destinations receive continuous cell-space `Point` values. On
cell-only terminals those points are synthesized at cell centers. Native, web,
and terminal-pixel hosts can provide sub-cell locations.

The runtime writes `PointerInputCapabilities` and `CellPixelMetrics` into the
environment before each render. Use those values for optional precision
indicators or direct-manipulation affordances. Layout itself remains cell-based.

Terminal-native sessions resolve mouse precision before the event pump starts.
`TerminalMouseInputResolution.preResolved` skips probing and uses the supplied
answer. Automatic resolution requires trustworthy cell metrics. Then it queries
SGR-Pixels 1016 with `CSI ? 1016 $ p`. Finally, it uses the documented compatibility
matrix only when the selected `TerminalMouseInputTrustPolicy` allows it.
All-motion hover reporting is enabled only while rendered views have
`onPointerHover` subscribers, then disabled again when the subscribers
disappear.

For the deeper focus model, see the `Focus` article in the `SwiftTUIViews`
module.

## Commit, Lifecycle, And Tasks

Lifecycle is driven by runtime lifetimes, with the resolved `Identity` kept as
the public/debug projection that appears in lifecycle events.

- A node appears when its `ViewNodeID` is present in the next committed tree but
  absent from the previous one
- A node disappears when its `ViewNodeID` is present in the previous committed
  tree but absent from the next one
- Reordering, layout movement, focus changes, clipping changes, or
  scroll-position changes do not count as lifecycle transitions if the runtime
  lifetime is preserved
- Off-screen or clipped nodes that remain in the tree do not disappear

The view graph finalizes each frame into explicit lifecycle events. The commit
planner packages these events into the lifecycle slot of the commit plan. This
slot also contains semantic handler-installation work.

### Ordering Rules

- Removal cancels any owned task before running disappear handlers
- Insertion runs appear handlers before starting any owned task
- Task replacement on a stable identity cancels the old task before starting the new one

### Task Rules

- A task starts when a runtime node appears with a task descriptor
- A task also starts when a stable runtime node gains a task descriptor
- A task survives ordinary frame updates when the runtime node and task
  descriptor are unchanged
- A task also survives a backing-node migration when its identity uniquely
  matches a single incoming runtime node and its task descriptor is
  unchanged; its running handle is transferred to the new owner
- A task restarts when the descriptor changes on the same runtime node
- A task also restarts when explicit identity replacement creates a new
  runtime lifetime, even if the descriptor compares equal
- A task cancels when its runtime node disappears with no uniquely matched
  replacement, when its descriptor is replaced, or when the runtime shuts
  down
- Selective dirty evaluation must re-run the graph node that authored lifecycle
  metadata before it commits a descendant update that can drop that
  metadata. The lifecycle identity remains the resolved node identity. The
  evaluation owner is an internal graph-retention detail.

The practical rule is simple: if the runtime lifetime is preserved, it is not a
lifecycle transition.

## State, Environment, Observation, And Isolation

The package uses `.defaultIsolation(.none)` in its package configuration. The
model uses explicit `@MainActor` annotations for SwiftUI-style authoring
isolation. It does not use blanket target isolation.

The shipped ownership model is split into three categories:

- Main-actor authoring and body evaluation:
  - `View`, ``Scene``, and ``App``
  - `Resolver.resolve(...)`
  - ``DefaultRenderer/render(_:context:proposal:frameInstant:)``
  - scene collection helpers, typed ``WindowIdentifier`` values, and ``WindowGroup`` root-view construction
  - action-bearing authoring APIs such as `Binding.init(get:set:)`, button actions, `OpenLinkAction` over typed `LinkDestination` values, `.onAppear`, `.onDisappear`, `.onChange(of:initial:_:)`, and `.task(...)`
- Main-actor runtime coordination and ownership:
  - ``RunLoop``
  - the state container
  - local action, focused-value, key, lifecycle, task, and pointer registries
  - retained frame and resolve-reuse stores
  - focus, pressed identity, lifecycle staging, and task reconciliation
  - terminal presentation commit boundaries
- Pure nonisolated frame products:
  - resolve context, environment snapshots, and resolved, measured, placed, semantic, draw, raster, and commit artifacts
- Genuinely concurrent I/O and host plumbing:
  - input readers
  - signal readers
  - terminal-host I/O
  - graphics or image transport support

### State Model

- `@State` persistence is keyed by graph scope, owner `ViewNodeID`, and the
  declaration's source-location ordinal
- Unkeyed owners follow their `StructuralPath`. Explicitly keyed owners can
  route the same `ViewNodeID` across structural moves through `EntityIdentity`
- Live runtime writes belong to the view graph that registered the callback.
  Another live graph can mount the same stateful view instance without
  inheriting the first graph's imperative writes
- Rebinding the same unkeyed view instance into a different structural position
  creates a different state slot. Rebinding a keyed entity can preserve state
  when the entity identity proves it is the same logical value
- Keying preserves state only while the owning runtime lifetime survives or is
  entity-routed. Own longer-lived state above the seams for active-tab bodies,
  deferred content, or presentation churn. Pass it down through bindings or
  explicit model state
- Active-tab local state can be intentionally temporary across tab changes.
  `TabView` resolves only the selected body. Hoist only the state that must
  survive tab churn. Opening or closing a presentation must not cause the same
  reset.
- The state container invalidates only when an `Equatable` state change actually changes value
- Projected bindings and local actions route through the same invalidation path
- Direct local actions restore the dynamic-property scope they were registered
  under so mutations remain bound to the right runtime graph
- Button actions, key-command handlers, dismiss closures, projected bindings,
  and other imperative paths must preserve the same authoring scope and
  dynamic-property scope. Each path then invalidates the same owner
- `@GestureState` follows the same graph-scoped binding lookup for imperative
  gesture updates, while still resetting to its construction-time seed when
  the gesture ends
- No-invalidator `DefaultRenderer` snapshots preserve same-instance test and
  preview ergonomics. If a reused view instance receives an imperative write,
  a later snapshot of that instance can observe it without a live invalidator

For the deeper keying tradeoffs, see the `State-Keying` article in the
`SwiftTUIViews` module.

### Environment Model

- An environment key's `Value` is `Sendable`
- Environment storage uses typed sendable boxes rather than raw erased payloads
- Environment snapshots use immutable value-style replacement semantics
- Style-affecting environment updates can change presentation without implying layout changes

### Observation Model

Observation uses the same invalidation path as `@State`. It does not use a
separate runtime.

- `resolveBody` and `EnvironmentReader` track observable reads through an internal observation bridge
- observable writes may occur on any executor, matching SwiftUI's allowance for background-task model writes; the bridge marshals them instead of trapping
- callbacks filter staleness and wake the scheduler at fire time, then the graph invalidation for the exact observed identity applies on the main actor at the next frame head
- generation tracking suppresses stale callbacks from older frames
- committed-frame pruning stops removed identities from continuing to invalidate hidden subtrees
- the package provides its own `Bindable`

Supported scenarios include body-driven reads, environment-driven observable
reads, bindable editing, and renders after observable edits.

## Incremental Delivery

The runtime is incremental in common steady-state paths. Idle renders reuse
measured and placed work and write no bytes. Local subtree updates keep work on
the dirty path. Focused-button and single-character-input frames do less work
than the initial paint. Full repaints still occur for the first frame, surface
resizes, raster attachment changes, and raster metadata changes. The
presentation boundary sanitizes terminal text and OSC 8 hyperlink destinations
before it writes bytes. `SIGWINCH` reads the terminal size and schedules a
fresh frame. It does not exit the run loop.

## Crash Recovery

The CLI runner installs a crash guard before the session enters raw mode. If
the process crashes because of `fatalError`, a segmentation fault, or another
fatal signal, the guard resets the terminal. The guard
disables mouse reporting, shows the cursor, resets style, exits the alternate
screen, and restores termios. Then it raises the signal again. Thus, the
terminal does not stay in raw mode.
