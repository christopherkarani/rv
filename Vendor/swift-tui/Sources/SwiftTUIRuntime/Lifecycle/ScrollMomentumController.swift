/// This is the root fix for the deferred momentum work: momentum is a *physics
/// simulation*, not an animation tween, so it does **not** go through the
/// animation controller (which interpolates render-time slots, not layout
/// inputs). It is also not a view concern, so it does not live in `ScrollView`
/// (a `PrimitiveView` with no `body`). Instead the run loop ticks this controller
/// on the same 33 ms deadline cadence it uses for animations, and feeds the
/// resulting integer offset deltas through `LocalScrollPositionRegistry.scrollBy`
/// — the existing imperative, edge-clamping scroll-mutation API. No synthetic
/// `.scrolled` events are involved.
///
/// The controller is intentionally pure and clock-agnostic: it owns no scheduler,
/// no registry, and no wall clock. `step(to:)` advances to a caller-supplied
/// instant and returns the integer cell deltas to apply; the run loop performs
/// the registry write and reports edge stops back via `cancel(_:)`. That keeps
/// the physics unit-testable with no `RunLoop`.
