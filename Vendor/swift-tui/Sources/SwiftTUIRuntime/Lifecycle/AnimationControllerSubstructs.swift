// Value-typed sub-structs that cluster the AnimationController's per-frame
// state.  Each struct owns a cohesive group of fields that are checkpointed,
// restored, and reset together.  Grouping them lets ``AnimationController``
// snapshot and restore whole structs with one memberwise assignment apiece
// instead of hand-listing ~25 individual fields three times — the compiler's
// memberwise value semantics now carry the totality contract, so a new field
// added to any group is automatically included in checkpoint/restore/reset.
//
// The controller exposes each field through a private computed accessor that
// forwards to the backing struct, so the intricate per-tick animation logic is
// untouched and behavior is identical.
