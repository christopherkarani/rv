  /// Animation deadlines do not enter this scope (F149). The controller owns
  /// active curve state, overlays, and completion drains; a deadline alone
  /// authors no new target value and therefore needs no view-graph evaluation.
  /// Independent input/state/focus/environment causes still contribute their
  /// ordinary dirty work on the same frame.
  ///
  /// Focus/press-only finite scopes are queued as graph-local dirty work by the
  /// frame head. The focus-sync scroll fallback remains root-forced because it
  /// cannot be attributed to an identity cone.
  /// Per-render-pass evaluation policy, shared by both frame drivers and
  /// recomputed PER convergence iteration, not once per scheduled frame: the
  /// eager focus-location rerender runs after a mid-frame relocation
  /// (default-focus adoption, an applied focus request, a focused control's
  /// departure) that a frame-start snapshot cannot have observed —
  /// `previousFrameFocusIdentity` only advances after the frame commits, so
  /// the second pass's scope unions the relocated focus target and its
  /// runtime readers. A stale scope here would let a focus reader outside it
  /// take retained reuse of pre-relocation content.
  ///
  /// The focus-sync rerender itself is selective (F08 lever B): the
  /// relocation cone plus the runtime focus readers already form the pass's
  /// finite suppression scope, the frame head queues that scope as graph-local
  /// dirty work, and the identities the relocation's side effects invalidated
  /// ride the pass's invalidation set (see ``rerenderScheduledFrame``). Two
  /// additions keep it sound:
  ///
  /// - When the previous pass updated `currentFocusedValues`, the
  ///   `@FocusedValue`/`@FocusedBinding` readers must ride this pass's scope:
  ///   the rerender path returns before the converged path's reader
  ///   invalidation, and this pass's convergence check compares against the
  ///   already-updated values — a reader outside the scope would never be
  ///   scheduled again and go permanently stale.
  /// - A scroll-reveal rerender repositions viewport content with no
  ///   attributable identity cone, so it keeps the root-forced fallback.
  ///
  /// Animation deadline-only frames remain eligible for whole-tree retained
  /// reuse and the animation injection stage's zero-computed-node skip.
