  /// TermUIPerf's emission-visible lane (`SWIFTTUI_PERF_EMISSION=1`) installs
  /// it in place of the semantic-host perf surface, so `present_bytes`,
  /// `present_strategy`, and `present_sync` in `frames.tsv` (and the
  /// `summary.json` emission aggregates) carry the true emitted escape stream
  /// for perf scenarios instead of the structural zeros the semantic-host
  /// path reports. The planner + emission cost lands inside `present_ms` and
  /// `total_ms`, deliberately: that cost was the measurement blind spot.
  /// Because the lane both adds that cost and changes the advertised
  /// capability profile, lane-on runs are only comparable with lane-on runs.
  ///
  /// The capability profile is fixed and deterministic
  /// (``laneCapabilityProfile``): unicode glyphs, truecolor styling,
  /// hyperlinks on, synchronized output ON, kitty graphics OFF
  /// (`graphicsCapabilities == .none`), terminal edit-operation lowering
  /// (CSI K) ON. Byte counts for identical scenario content are therefore
  /// stable run to run.
  ///
  /// Baseline semantics reuse ``TerminalPresentationSession`` faithfully: the
  /// planner diffs against `lastWrittenSurface` and the damage hint flows
  /// through `presentationDamage(requested:)`. The sink is synchronous, so
  /// every emission "reaches the terminal": the prepared surface becomes the
  /// written baseline immediately, no frame can drop, and the trust latch
  /// never trips. That matches the run loop's previously-presented damage
  /// baseline exactly and keeps the hinted diffs honest.
