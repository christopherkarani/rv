/// The host-neutral **serialization seam** for a ``SemanticHostFrame``.
///
/// Non-terminal hosts (WASI/WebHost, Android) serialize a committed frame
/// into the converged web-surface wire (`WebSurfaceFrameEncoder`; the legacy
/// Android keyed-JSON format retired with convergence Stage C4). The wire
/// serializes a defined **subset** of a frame: the raster, the sequence, the
/// focus, the damage, and exactly three of `SemanticSnapshot`'s ten fields —
/// accessibility nodes, announcements, and scroll routes. The remaining
/// semantic records (interaction/focus/navigation/selection regions, scroll
/// targets, named coordinate spaces, accessibility warnings) are
/// routing/diagnostic data that hosts do not serialize.
///
/// Historically each host's encoder reached into `SemanticHostFrame`/
/// `SemanticSnapshot` independently, so a field added to the host contract
/// had to be wired into two encoders by hand — and a forgotten one silently
/// dropped data on one host with no compile error. `HostFrameProjection` is the single seam both
/// encoders read a frame through, and it names the host-serialized surface
/// explicitly:
/// - the host-serialized semantic lists are surfaced as the named accessors
///   ``accessibilityNodes`` / ``accessibilityAnnouncements`` / ``scrollRoutes``
///   (the enumerable "what a host emits" contract, anchored by
///   `HostFrameProjectionContractTests`);
/// - the focus presentation is **derived once here** so hosts that surface it
///   (Android) and hosts that surface only the focused identity (WASI) share one
///   derivation.
///
/// The projection carries values untransformed — each encoder keeps its own
/// serialization, so its exact wire bytes are unchanged. The shared
/// ``HostWireFrameModel`` builds on this seam: it derives every emitted
/// value once per frame, and the encoders are format adapters over it. It retains the full
/// ``semantics`` snapshot (not a copy of the subset) so snapshot-threaded
/// encoders pass it through identically.
///
/// `package`-scoped: an internal intermediate used inside the encoders, never
/// part of any host's public API.
