/// A view that cycles through a sequence of phases.
/// It applies an animation between each pair of consecutive phases.
///
/// It matches the SwiftUI `phaseAnimator` family of APIs.
/// It has two modes:
///
/// ### Loop mode
///
/// `init(_:content:animation:)` starts a background task.
/// The task walks the phases in a loop forever.
/// It advances after each animation completes through the
/// ``withAnimation(_:completionCriteria:_:completion:)`` batch drain.
///
///     PhaseAnimator([Phase.a, .b, .c]) { phase in
///       Text("hello").foregroundStyle(phase.color)
///     } animation: { phase in
///       .easeInOut(duration: .milliseconds(500))
///     }
///
/// ### Trigger mode
///
/// `init(_:trigger:content:animation:)` walks through the phases
/// exactly once whenever the external `trigger` value changes.
/// Starting from the current phase, the animator advances one step
/// at a time until it returns to phase 0 (the rest state).
/// This behavior matches the trigger-driven SwiftUI phase animator.
/// It produces the classic "press button, bounce, return to rest" pattern:
///
///     @State private var tapCount = 0
///     PhaseAnimator([Phase.rest, .grow, .shrink], trigger: tapCount) {
///       phase in
///       Text("★").scaleEffect(phase.scale)
///     }
///     Button("bounce") { tapCount += 1 }
///
/// The initial mount is not a trigger change.
/// The view renders at phase 0 without an animation. It reacts only to subsequent changes.
/// Reduce motion reconciles the retained phase to phase 0 and consumes trigger
/// changes without playing a cycle. Restoring motion keeps the animator at rest.
///
/// ### Animation curve
///
/// The `animation` closure returns the curve to use when
/// transitioning INTO the given phase.  Returning nil snaps to that
/// phase without animating (the content still updates but the
/// controller does not add an animation to the queue).
///
/// - Note: The phases array must not be empty. Calling
///   `PhaseAnimator([])` is a programmer error and will stop in
///   debug builds.
