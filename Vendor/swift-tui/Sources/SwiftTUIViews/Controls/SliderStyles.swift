public import SwiftTUICore

/// Defines the visual composition of a ``Slider``.
///
/// A slider style is body-producing: ``makeBody(configuration:)`` receives a
/// ``SliderStyleConfiguration`` and returns the replacement body for the
/// control. The configuration hands the style the authored label, the
/// framework-formatted value text, the normalized
/// ``SliderStyleConfiguration/fractionCompleted``, the track cell count, the
/// enabled, focus, and press state, and the
/// ``SliderStyleConfiguration/track(content:)`` route wrapper for the
/// primitive's pointer target.
///
/// The primitive keeps what makes the control a slider: its focus stop, the
/// value binding, clamping and step rounding, arrow-key and wheel adjustment,
/// Space activation, and the accessibility role. The configuration exposes no
/// binding, so a style never writes the value.
///
/// Two built-ins ship. ``LinearSliderStyle`` draws a labelled row with a
/// position marker on a track, and ``AutomaticSliderStyle`` is a fixed alias
/// of it. Apply either with `sliderStyle(_:)`, which stores the style
/// in the environment for its subtree; the nearest modifier wins.
///
/// A conformance is a `Sendable` value type; a class cannot conform.
