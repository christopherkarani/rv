/// Composes a menu's trigger and inline or floating content.
///
/// This is a body-producing family: the framework hands
/// ``MenuStyle/makeBody(configuration:)`` the captured trigger label, the
/// captured commands, the presentation binding, and the menu's render state,
/// and the view it returns renders in the menu's place. The style decides what
/// the trigger looks like and whether the commands float above the layout or
/// expand inline beneath it.
///
/// ``Menu`` keeps everything that makes a menu a menu: the focus stop, the
/// expansion state and its binding, the keyboard activation, the Escape
/// dismissal while presented, the accessibility role, and the portal's
/// lifetime. A style composes around them through two route wrappers,
/// ``MenuStyleConfiguration/trigger(content:)`` for the pointer target and
/// ``MenuStyleConfiguration/portal(presentation:content:)`` for the floating
/// surface.
///
/// A presented menu must reach its commands: place the portal wrapper, or place
/// `configuration.content` inline while `isPresented` is true. A style that
/// does neither reports `style.missingRequiredRoute`, and the automatic body
/// renders for that resolve. Disabling a presented menu leaves it presented
/// with its commands and trigger disabled, and its Escape handler stays
/// installed.
///
/// The built-ins are ``AnyMenuStyle/automatic`` (a full-width trigger row with
/// the label, a spacer, and a caret, over a floating surface),
/// ``AnyMenuStyle/button`` (a bordered trigger over the same floating surface),
/// ``AnyMenuStyle/borderlessButton`` (the same trigger without the border), and
/// ``AnyMenuStyle/inline`` (the automatic trigger row with the commands
/// expanded below it in normal layout). Unlike most families, `automatic` is
/// its own treatment rather than an alias of a named built-in. Apply a style
/// with `menuStyle(_:)`, which stores it in the environment for that subtree;
/// the nearest modifier wins.
///
/// A conformance is a `Sendable` value type; a class cannot conform. A style
/// may store dynamic properties, which are prepared before `makeBody` runs.
