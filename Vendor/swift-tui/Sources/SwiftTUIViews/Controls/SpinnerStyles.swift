/// An extensible spinner style.
///
/// A spinner style resolves a ``SpinnerStylePresentation`` — glyph frames,
/// cadence, and paint — from the spinner's render state. The `Spinner`
/// primitive owns its animation task, iteration state, cancellation
/// identity, stage semantics, and reduced-motion behavior; a style cannot
/// change them.
///
/// This is a presentation-value family: a conformance implements
/// ``resolvePresentation(for:)`` and returns data, and the framework keeps the
/// composition because the cadence is the primitive's invariant. Apply a style
/// with `spinnerStyle(_:)`, which stores it in the environment for its
/// subtree; the nearest modifier wins, and a ``Spinner`` composed by another
/// style, such as ``CircularProgressViewStyle``, inherits it too.
///
/// The built-ins are ``GlyphSpinnerStyle`` values: `.automatic`, the braille
/// loop, and 37 further glyph presets. A custom sequence usually needs no
/// conformance at all, just a ``GlyphSpinnerStyle`` with your frames; conform
/// when the presentation depends on the configuration.
///
/// An invalid presentation, meaning empty active frames, a non-positive
/// interval, or active frames of mixed cell width, reports
/// `style.invalidPresentation` and renders the automatic presentation instead.
/// The spinner reports once per invalid style value per spinner, not once per
/// animated frame, and reports again when the style value changes.
///
/// A conformance is a `Sendable` value type; a class cannot conform.
