/// A picker style also owns one piece of behavior the other body-producing
/// families do not have: ``PickerStyle/selectionDelta(for:)`` decides which keys

/// focus stop, writes the selection binding, dispatches option routes, and
/// carries the accessibility semantics whatever the style returns.

/// for the subtree, so the nearest modifier wins. The built-ins are
