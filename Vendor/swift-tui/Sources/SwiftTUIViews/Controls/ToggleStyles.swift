/// Defines the visual composition of a ``Toggle``.
///
/// A toggle style is body-producing: for every pass the primitive resolves a
/// ``ToggleStyleConfiguration`` and calls
/// ``ToggleStyle/makeBody(configuration:)``, and the returned view stands in for
/// the toggle. The configuration carries the captured authored label, the state
/// binding, and read-only render state.
///
/// The style owns appearance only. The focus stop, the activation keys and
/// pointer route, and the accessibility semantics stay with the primitive
/// whatever the style returns, and the binding writes through to the authored
/// source of truth.
///
/// Apply a style with `toggleStyle(_:)`. The value is stored in the environment
/// for the subtree, so the nearest modifier wins. The built-ins are
/// ``AnyToggleStyle/automatic`` (radio glyphs), ``AnyToggleStyle/checkbox``
/// (checkbox glyphs), and ``AnyToggleStyle/button`` (a highlighted row); each is
/// a fixed treatment rather than an alias of another built-in.
///

/// a class conformance does not compile.
