/// These drawings do not need to fit the shape fill and stroke model.

/// - ``init(_:grid:)`` takes a value-type `CanvasDrawing`. This is the

///   dedup identical canvases across re-renders.
/// - ``init(_:grid:_:)`` keys an ad-hoc drawing closure to an `Equatable`
///   input, keeping the dedup benefit without a dedicated drawing type.
/// - ``init(grid:_:)-(_,(CanvasContext)->Void)`` takes a bare drawing closure for quick,
///   throwaway drawing code. Its drawing compares by identity, so it
///   re-rasterizes on every re-render.
/// - ``pixelGrid(width:height:pixels:mode:)`` renders a dense, pre-resolved
///   `[Color?]` bitmap and applies the matching frame for you.
