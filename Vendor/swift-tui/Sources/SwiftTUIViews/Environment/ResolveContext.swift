// `ResolveContext` is the per-pass configuration threaded through view
// resolution. Its public face is small — authored identity, environment,
// transaction, and invalidation scope — while the bulk of its surface is
// `package`: the runtime registries and lowering seams that the framework
// populates and reads while resolving a subtree. The `child`, `indexedChild`,
// and `replacingIdentity` builders derive the context for nested views; the
// `settingEnvironment` / `transformingEnvironment` builders fold environment
// edits back into the resolved snapshot.
//
// Split out of `Environment.swift` so that file stays focused on the
// environment value types (`EnvironmentKey`, `EnvironmentValues`,
// `Environment`, `EnvironmentReader`). `ResolveContext`'s own `private static`
// helpers travel with it; the only cross-file dependency is
// `EnvironmentValues.applying(to:reuseStyle:)`, which was widened from
// `fileprivate` to `package` so this file can reach it.
