// The capture-bind pass (plan 2026-08-20-001 Stages 2–3).
//
// A sibling of the dynamic-property update pass that runs immediately before
// user-authored code evaluates, at three seams: `resolveViewElements`'
// resolvable branch (every `ResolvableView` evaluation), its plain-body tail
// (every `body` evaluation, transparent forwarding containers included), and
// the forwarding seams where a composed `ViewModifier` or style struct runs
// its body (`bindingForwardedDynamicPropertyCaptures`). It writes each
// `@State` (and future `CaptureBindableDynamicProperty`) field's owner into
// the exact container copy that code consumes, so closures it creates carry
// their state owner instead of re-deriving it from ambient dispatch scope at
// fire time.
//
// The pass is deliberately independent of the update pass: certification,
// the `ForwardedDynamicPropertyPreparationScope` handoff, and third-party
// `DynamicProperty.update` semantics are untouched. Binding is idempotent —
// every fresh evaluation overwrites — and reuse serves never run it (no body
// runs on a serve; previously registered closures keep their captures, and
// reuse preserves the owner's node).
//
// The overwrite is unconditional because authored containers are value types
// (plan 2026-08-29-001): the pass writes through a copy private to one mount
// and one evaluation, so no two mounts can reach the same wrapper slot. That
// invariant is what removed the shared-container tier this pass used to carry.

/// One field's bind operation, bound once per container type: either writes
/// the capture into a `CaptureBindableDynamicProperty` field, or recurses
/// into a nested `DynamicProperty` container with a path-qualified binding.

/// act; every application site spells `unsafe`.

  /// pass's field discovery so an `AdditionalDynamicPropertyUpdating`
