// The declared-builder consumption tail.
//
// A container that splices a resolved child into its own children array has to
// answer the same three-case question every time: an unmodified `EmptyView` at
// the child's own identity is dropped, an unmodified `Group` at that identity
// is spliced (its children lifted into the enclosing array), and anything else
// passes through as one child.
//
// Both dropped and spliced nodes were minted by `resolveView` and then end up
// in no children array, so they are *detached*: reporting one to
// resolve-lifetime scope both marks it observed and anchors its lifetime to
// the nearest declaring host. Failing to report leaves the mint unanchored.
//
// The shape was written out at three sites. They did NOT agree about
// reporting, and that disagreement is preserved here as a named policy rather
// than quietly normalised — see ``DeclaredChildConsumptionPolicy``.

/// Which detached mints a consumption site anchors *eagerly*.
///
/// "Eagerly" is the whole content of these flags. Anchoring itself is
/// guaranteed by `closeResolveLifetimeScope`, which owns any observed node that
/// reaches scope close without a durable owner; reporting at consumption time
/// only moves the same anchor, to the same host, earlier in the same scope.
/// The three shipped policies differ, and are named rather than averaged away
/// because the reasons differ — but none of them decides whether a mint
/// survives.
