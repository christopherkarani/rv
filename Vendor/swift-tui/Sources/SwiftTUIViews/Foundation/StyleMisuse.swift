// The shared misuse rule for style-facing contracts: misuse never traps and is
// never silent.
//
// A style can hand the framework an invalid presentation value — empty spinner
// frames, a non-positive cadence, a multi-cell indicator glyph. The resolving
// surface validates what it received; on any problem it emits one
// `style.invalidPresentation` runtime issue and renders the family's automatic
// presentation for that resolve. Nothing traps on a style-supplied value, and
// no invalid value reaches layout, where it could corrupt realized bounds.
//
// This is the channel only. Each family owns its validation predicate and its
// automatic fallback. Every family records through
// `ImperativeRuntimeIssueQueue`, which the frame head drains into that frame's
// issue channel after the graph resolves, so a resolve-time report surfaces
// on the same frame.

/// Constructs and routes the runtime issues shared by every style family's
/// presentation validation.
