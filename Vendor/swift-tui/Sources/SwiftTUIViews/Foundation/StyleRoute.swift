// Route wrappers: the one way a style body installs a synthetic pointer hit
// target around the view it composes for that target.
//
// `TabViewStyleItemConfiguration.route` was the first route wrapper. Every
// later family hands its style the same shape — a public wrapper method on
// the configuration (`route`, `track`, `decrement`, `increment`, `trigger`,
// the palette command's `route`) — backed by this package machinery, so the
// rules shared by every route live in one place:
//
// - A route wrapper never traps. Misuse degrades and reports.
// - Omitting an optional route removes only the pointer target. Keyboard
//   interaction is owned by the primitive, which registers its handlers
//   independently of anything the style body composes.
// - Installing the same route more than once in one style-body resolve
//   emits `style.duplicateRoute` and the first installation wins: later
//   installations render their content without a pointer target.
// - A fixture-constructed configuration carries no control identity, so its
//   route wrappers are inert: they render their content and install nothing.
//   That branch is the configuration's (`if let controlIdentity`), which is
//   why this view takes a non-optional identity.
//
// The duplicate ledger is scoped to one style-body resolve
// (`resolveStyleBody`). A selective re-run of an evaluator inside the body
// runs without it and installs whatever it resolves, so a duplicate the
// first full resolve already reported can reappear as a second live target
// on such a frame. The same applies to a subtree the stack-lean resolve
// profile cuts at its depth cap and drains from the outermost resolve, which
// is outside every ledger scope. Both are degraded states of an
// already-reported or unreported misuse, accepted over the alternative — a
// ledger that outlives the resolve and misreads a route that legitimately
// moved between structural slots.
//
// A container that resolves several candidates and places one
// (`ViewThatFits`) is the one place a route legitimately appears more than
// once in a resolve. Each candidate claims on its own alternative of the
// ledger (`withStyleRouteAlternatives`), so sibling candidates do not report
// against each other while a candidate re-installing an outer route still
// does.
