/// A view that compares its wrapped content with its previous value through `==`.
/// If the content is unchanged, the renderer reuses the wrapped subtree without evaluating it again.
///
/// SwiftTUI's memoized-body reuse requires unchanged view inputs, environment,
/// and current dependency certificates throughout the committed subtree.
/// Scalar `@State` reads and tracked observation registrations can be certified.
/// Uncovered reads, including opaque state and focus or press state, prevent reuse.
/// ``EquatableView`` supplies an explicit comparison boundary for content that
/// already conforms to `Equatable`; its `Content: Equatable` bound is required.
///
/// Prefer direct `Equatable` conformance when the view itself is the intended
/// boundary. Use this wrapper to create a distinct boundary around its content.
/// Both forms validate the subtree's recorded dependencies before reuse.
/// Equality must still account for authored inputs, including values captured by
/// closures, that dependency tracking cannot independently validate.
///
/// > Important: `==` is a correctness contract, not a hint. If it ignores a
/// > value the wrapped subtree depends on (the classic captured-closure hazard),
/// > the reused subtree will be stale. This behavior matches the documentation for
/// > SwiftUI `EquatableView`.
///
/// Note: Unlike the SwiftUI wrapper, this wrapper occupies its own graph node.
/// This node is an `"EquatableView"` structural-path segment.
/// Thus, `.equatable()` inside a `ForEach` or conditional shifts identity relative to the unwrapped form.
/// Conform the
/// boundary view to `Equatable` directly when identity continuity matters.
///
/// Usually applied through ``View/equatable()`` rather than
/// constructed directly.
