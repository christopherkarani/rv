// We cannot redeclare `typealias Body = Never` here because Swift rejects
// duplicate typealias declarations for the same type in the same module
// (even when the RHS matches). The `View` conformance's witness IS the
// explicit `Body = Never` witness for `Gesture` as well — it is not a
// silent cross-protocol dependency: both protocols share the same module and
// their `Never` extensions are co-located, so any future change to one is
// immediately visible to the other.
//
// `Never.Value = Never` makes `Body.Value == Value` vacuously true for the
// recursive `Never: Gesture` conformance. Primitives that declare
// `typealias Body = Never` but have a non-Never `Value` do not get the
// default `_makeRecognizer` (which requires `Body.Value == Value`); they
// must — and do — provide their own implementation.
