# Dismissal Is Data

Model presentation visibility in the presenting view. SwiftTUI reads a
Boolean binding or an optional identifiable item to create a presentation,
and dismissal clears that same source value.

## Present with a Boolean

Use a Boolean when the presented content does not need a separate model value:

```swift
struct InspectorHost: View {
  @State private var showsInspector = false

  var body: some View {
    Button("Inspect") {
      showsInspector = true
    }
    .sheet(
      isPresented: $showsInspector,
      onDismiss: {
        // The sheet has left the committed rendered tree.
      }
    ) {
      Text("Inspector")
    }
  }
}
```

Escape, a built-in close action, or an application write of `false` all clear
the binding. The optional `onDismiss` callback observes the resulting teardown.
It is not the command that performs dismissal.

## Present an identifiable item

Use an optional item when the presentation is the visual form of selected
application data:

```swift
struct Document: Identifiable, Sendable {
  var id: String
  var title: String
}

struct DocumentHost: View {
  @State private var inspectedDocument: Document?

  var body: some View {
    Button("Inspect README") {
      inspectedDocument = Document(id: "readme", title: "README")
    }
    .sheet(item: $inspectedDocument) { document in
      Text("Inspecting \(document.title)")
    }
  }
}
```

The content closure receives the current item. Replacing its value with another
value that has the same ID refreshes the mounted content without losing local
state. Replacing the ID tears down the old activation and mounts a new one.
Setting the item to `nil` dismisses it.

Item forms are available for sheets, alerts, confirmation dialogs, popovers,
and full-screen covers. A full-screen cover uses the same data contract while
occupying the complete terminal proposal without a sheet header, card inset,
border, or implicit close button.

## Keep simultaneous presentations independent

When multiple presentation sources are active, SwiftTUI preserves each
source's own binding, mounted state, tasks, and dismissal callback. Sheets,
full-screen covers, popovers, and menus remain mounted as separate surfaces.
The most recently activated surface is drawn above earlier surfaces across
families: a menu opened inside a sheet or popover appears above its presenter,
and a sheet subsequently opened from that menu appears above the menu.
Painting, pointer hit testing, and Escape share this order. The topmost modal
blocks interaction with the base and earlier surfaces while keeping their
content mounted. Later nonmodal surfaces remain interactive.

When several families first activate in the same reconciliation pass, their
priority from bottom to top is toast, menu, sheet/full-screen cover, popover,
confirmation dialog, then alert. Presentations activated in a later pass appear
above them regardless of family.

Alerts and confirmation dialogs instead form first-in, first-out queues. Only
the oldest active prompt is visible. A waiting prompt's source remains active,
and its content mounts after the runtime dismisses each earlier prompt. Escape
dismisses the most recently activated *visible* presentation across families,
so a queued prompt cannot intercept dismissal from a visible surface.

## Preserve each source's lifetime

Presentation identity is scoped to its source. The same explicit ID in two
independent source scopes does not merge their sheets. Conditional portal
siblings can appear without replacing an existing source's state, and chained
toasts retain the environment at their own declaration.

Floating menus anchor to their source control's placed geometry and follow it
when it moves, with viewport-edge clamping. A bindingless `popoverTip` remembers
each dismissed tip for the lifetime of its anchor; replacing the anchor begins
a new lifetime. Hoist application-owned dismissal state when it must outlive
that anchor.

## Observe teardown at the presenter

`onDismiss` runs once after a previously committed activation disappears. It
does not run for an initially inactive binding. The callback follows the same
contract for direct state writes, Escape, built-in actions, toast expiration,
item-ID replacement, and removal of the presenting subtree.

Presented content does not receive an ambient dismiss command. If content owns
a dismissal control, give it the binding or an application action that clears
the source data. This keeps navigation and presentation decisions visible in
the state owner and makes restoration, testing, and deep linking predictable.
