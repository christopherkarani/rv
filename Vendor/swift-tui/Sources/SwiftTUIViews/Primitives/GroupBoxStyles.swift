public import SwiftTUICore

/// Defines the composition of a ``GroupBox`` through its authored slots.
///
/// This is a body-producing family: the framework hands
/// ``GroupBoxStyle/makeBody(configuration:)`` the optional label, the captured
/// content, and the control prominence in effect, and the view it returns
/// renders in the group box's place. The style owns the chrome: border,
/// padding, title placement, and paint.
///
/// A group box is passive. Styling introduces no focus stop, action, or
/// accessibility role of its own, and controls authored inside a slot keep
/// their own behavior. A slot placed in the body keeps its authoring scope, so
/// state and tasks declared in it still belong to the declaration site. Unlike
/// ``ControlGroupStyle``, this family does not retain a slot's child state when
/// a style omits the slot or hosts it somewhere else, so keep a slot in the
/// body when its content owns state.
///
/// To match the built-in chrome, read
/// `configuration.styleEnvironment.groupBoxChrome(prominence:)`: it returns the
/// foreground and border paints the bordered built-in draws, a neutral border
/// at standard prominence and the accent tone at
/// `ControlProminence.increased`.
///
/// ``AnyGroupBoxStyle/bordered`` frames the content in a rounded border with
/// one cell of interior padding; ``AnyGroupBoxStyle/plain`` renders the label
/// and content with no border or padding.
/// ``AnyGroupBoxStyle/automatic`` is a fixed alias of `bordered`, not a third
/// treatment. Apply a style with `groupBoxStyle(_:)`, which stores it in the
/// environment for that subtree; the nearest modifier wins.
///
/// A conformance is a `Sendable` value type; a class cannot conform. A style
/// may store dynamic properties, which are prepared before `makeBody` runs.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct BracketGroupBoxStyle: GroupBoxStyle {
///   func makeBody(configuration: GroupBoxStyleConfiguration) -> some View {
