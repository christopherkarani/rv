/// outline for the proposed rect) **or** ``geometry`` (one of the analytic
/// primitive cases). Bidirectional defaults connect these functions.
/// A custom shape that implements only `path(in:)` gets a `.path` ``geometry`` value.
/// A primitive that implements only `geometry` gets a generated `path(in:)` value.
/// Implement at least one. If you implement neither, the defaults recurse.
///
/// ``kindName``, ``insetAmount``, ``trimStart`` and ``trimEnd`` are rendering
/// plumbing with defaults, so a conforming type normally never touches them. They are plain (defaulted)
/// requirements rather than SPI. Thus, types *outside* this module can conform.
/// An `@_spi` requirement has no visible default witness across a module boundary.
/// `insetAmount` must also dispatch dynamically through ``InsetShape``, and the
/// trim through ``TrimmedShape``, so they cannot be non-requirement helpers.
///
/// The runtime evaluates `path(in:)` against the unit rectangle (`0,0,1,1`) during resolve.
/// During rasterization, it scales the normalized path into the placed frame.
/// Thus, a custom shape is relative to its frame and stretches to fill it.
/// The shape does not use the pixel-aspect correction that ``Circle`` uses.
