/// keeps rounded corners while one that builds a value from `init()` gets menu
/// chrome. All dimensions are terminal cells; the anchor, the placement search,
/// focus, modal policy, and dismissal belong to the declaration.

/// The surface validates the value before rendering it. A negative inset or
/// minimum width, a `maximumWidth` that is not positive or is below
/// `minimumWidth`, a `maximumHeight` that is not positive, or a cell count too
/// large to add to a terminal extent reports one `style.invalidPresentation`
/// runtime issue, and the declaration's baseline renders for that resolve. The
/// size bound is representability, not the terminal: a count larger than any
/// terminal is still valid. Nothing traps on a style value.
