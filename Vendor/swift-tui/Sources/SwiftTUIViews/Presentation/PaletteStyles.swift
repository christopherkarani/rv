public import SwiftTUICore

/// Composes a command palette from its declaration's command data.
///
/// A palette style is a body-producing style:
/// ``PaletteStyle/makeBody(configuration:)`` returns the view the presented
/// palette renders. The ``PaletteStyleConfiguration`` hands it the palette's
/// title and the commands the scopes in effect contributed, each carrying its
/// display strings, whether it is enabled, an opaque identity, a
/// ``PaletteStyleConfiguration/Command/route(content:)`` wrapper, and a
/// ``PaletteStyleConfiguration/Command/perform()`` method; the configuration
/// itself carries ``PaletteStyleConfiguration/dismiss()``.
///
/// The style owns what the palette shows: filtering, ordering, selection, the
/// key handling inside its own body, and how a row looks. The declaration keeps
/// the presentation binding, the sheet the palette sits in, the contributions
/// themselves, and the rule that performing a command dismisses the palette. A
/// style cannot enable a disabled contribution or reach one the scope has
/// withdrawn.
///
/// The built-in ``AnyPaletteStyle/automatic`` is ``DefaultPaletteStyle``. Apply
/// one with `paletteStyle(_:)` outside the `paletteSheet(...)` declaration: the
/// palette reads the nearest style from the environment where the sheet is
/// declared, so a modifier applied to the sheet's own content is not read.
/// Conform with a `Sendable` struct or enum; a class cannot conform.
///
/// ```swift
/// struct TwoColumnPaletteStyle: PaletteStyle {
///   func makeBody(configuration: PaletteStyleConfiguration) -> some View {
///     VStack(alignment: .leading) {
///       Text(configuration.title)
///       ForEach(configuration.commands) { command in
///         command.route {
///           Button(command.name) { command.perform() }
///             .disabled(!command.isEnabled)
