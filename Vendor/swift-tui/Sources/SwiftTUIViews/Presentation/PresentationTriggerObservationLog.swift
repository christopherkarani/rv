/// Declarative presentations register through a preference that only the
/// portal root's own resolve consumes. The frame head used to force-queue the
/// portal root whenever the frame's invalidation set was non-empty so an
/// activation flip could never be missed — at the cost of a root-rooted
/// frontier on every invalidation frame. Emitters now report each resolve
/// here instead, and the head escalates to a portal-root evaluation only when
/// an observation (or a departed declared source) proves the overlay-entry
/// set may have changed.
///
/// The log lives on ``PresentationPortalState`` (stable across frames) so
/// evaluator closures captured on earlier frames keep reporting into the
/// current frame's log; the frame head resets it at every head attempt.
