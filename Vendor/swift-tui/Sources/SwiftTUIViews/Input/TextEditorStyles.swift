public import SwiftTUICore

/// Defines the visual composition of a ``TextEditor``.
///
/// A text editor style is body-producing: ``makeBody(configuration:)``
/// receives a ``TextEditorStyleConfiguration`` and returns the replacement
/// body. The configuration hands the style one protected slot, the editing
/// surface itself, plus the enabled and focus state; a style surrounds that
/// slot with chrome rather than rebuilding it.
///
/// The primitive keeps everything inside the slot: the text binding, editing
/// keys, selection, the caret and its wrapped movement, scrolling, the single
/// focus stop the editor exposes, and the accessibility role. The slot's
/// measured viewport drives caret navigation, so padding a style adds is
/// accounted for.
///
/// Three built-ins ship. ``RoundedBorderTextEditorStyle`` frames the surface,
/// ``AutomaticTextEditorStyle`` is a fixed alias of it, and
/// ``PlainTextEditorStyle`` removes the chrome. Apply one with
/// `textEditorStyle(_:)`, which stores the style in the environment for
/// its subtree; the nearest modifier wins.
///
