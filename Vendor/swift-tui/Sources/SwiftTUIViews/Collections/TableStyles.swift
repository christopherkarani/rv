/// A table style is a presentation-value style: it implements
/// ``TableStyle/resolvePresentation(for:)`` and returns a
/// `TableStylePresentation` holding the border glyph set, the header foreground
/// and background paints, the content insets, and the border paint. It never
/// builds a body, so the table primitive keeps virtualization, selection, header
/// semantics, cell layout, pointer routes, and scroll currency; a style cannot
/// change them. List treatments are a separate family; see ``ListStyle``.
///
/// Apply a style with `tableStyle(_:)`. The value is stored in the
/// environment for the subtree, so the nearest modifier above a table wins. The
/// built-ins are ``AnyTableStyle/automatic``, ``AnyTableStyle/inset``, and
/// ``AnyTableStyle/bordered``; `.automatic` is a fixed alias of `.inset`.
///
/// A conforming type must be a value type and `Sendable`, because the
/// environment carries it across resolves. The resolved presentation is not
/// validated and has no per-field fallback: every field is used as returned.
