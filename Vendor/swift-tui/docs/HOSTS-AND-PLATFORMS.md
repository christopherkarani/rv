# Hosts and Platforms (internal notes)

The canonical, consumer-facing host matrix, per-host engine profiles,
host-frame contract, platform support matrix, and embedding overview live in
the published DocC article
[Hosts And Platforms](../Sources/SwiftTUIRuntime/SwiftTUIRuntime.docc/Hosts-And-Platforms.md)
(`SwiftTUIRuntime` catalog). Keep that article authoritative; this file holds
only the maintainer-facing context that does not belong on the documentation
site.

## Where host code lives

The in-package integration code lives under `Platforms/`: terminal launch,
WASI, localhost WebHost, Android, and shared embedding contracts are SwiftPM
targets here. Hosts are partitioned across repositories by **distribution
contract**, not by backend. A host in another package ecosystem keeps that half
in a dedicated sibling repository. These repositories are
`SwiftTUI/swift-tui-web` (Bun/npm) and `SwiftTUI/swift-tui-android`
(Gradle/Maven AAR + plugin). Tagged releases or released artifacts couple them
back to this package. The Apple-SDK-gated `SwiftUIHost` product is
wholly external, in
[`SwiftTUI/swift-tui-swiftui`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-swiftui).
These boundaries keep foreign package managers and Apple-only framework
imports out of this core SwiftPM package. Repository ownership and release
boundaries are recorded in the
[`swift-tui-org` coordination repository's README](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-org#readme).

## Maintainer notes

- **Wire contract.** The normative converged host-wire record, state,
  capability, delivery, and consumer contract is
  [HOST-WIRE-CONTRACT.md](HOST-WIRE-CONTRACT.md). The `SwiftTUIAndroidHost`
  and `swift-tui-web`/`swift-tui-swiftui` implementations must track it; the
  fixture corpus is byte-synced across those repositories (see
  [DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-org/blob/main/docs/swift-tui/DEVELOPMENT.md)).
- **Platform declarations.** The package declares `macOS 15` and `iOS 18`
  platforms unless the build sets `DISABLE_EXPLICIT_PLATFORMS=1` (Linux CI
  does, to skip the Apple platform restriction).
- **Android packaging state.** The current `AndroidGallery` example packages
  arm64 only, although the Swift host cross-compiles for arm64 and x86_64.
  Android host behavior gaps are tracked in the
  [divergence and gap register](../Sources/SwiftTUIViews/SwiftTUIViews.docc/Divergences-And-Gaps.md).
- **Embedding gaps.** Sixel/Kitty graphics inside embedded panes, the Kitty
  keyboard protocol, OSC 99 notification namespacing, and process
  reattachment after an app restart are not implemented. See the
  [divergence and gap register](../Sources/SwiftTUIViews/SwiftTUIViews.docc/Divergences-And-Gaps.md).
- **CI floors.** GitHub `macos-26` is the macOS CI floor. iOS CI builds
  host-compatible products but does not run tests.
- **Windows CI.** `.github/workflows/windows-build.yml` builds all targets +
  test bundles on `windows-11-arm` (arm64) and `windows-2022` (amd64) via
  `compnerd/gha-setup-swift`. It runs nightly (skipping itself when `main`
  has not moved since its last green run), on every release tag, and on
  dispatch — not on push, so the push verdict stays Linux-only and under 30
  minutes. It is deliberately **not** wired into the org-root gates (per-repo
  version drift is planned). Windows test runners need
  `swift test -Xlinker /STACK:16777216` — the default 1 MiB runner stack
  kills deep-descent suites.
- **Windows checkouts are LF.** The committed `.gitattributes`
  (`* text=auto eol=lf`) exists because `core.autocrlf=true` checkouts append
  `\r` to fixture lines and break byte-compare and parser tests. Never remove
  it; a CRLF-smudged working tree is the first suspect for
  Windows-only fixture failures.
- **Windows dev workflow.** The macOS→Parallels-VM loop (prlctl exec, the
  `\\Mac\Home` share, the no-console trap, exit-code capture) is documented in
  the appendix of the org repo's
  `docs/plans/2026-08-16-001-windows-support-module-recut-plan.md`.
