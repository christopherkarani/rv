# SwiftTUI Documentation

SwiftTUI is a SwiftUI-shaped UI framework for the terminal, written in Swift.
You author `View` values in the same way as SwiftUI. SwiftTUI resolves,
lays out, and renders them as terminal text, a browser canvas, or a raster
surface embedded in a host app.

This folder holds the **`HEAD`-state architecture and contract documentation**
for this package. Developer-facing guides and API reference live in the
in-source DocC catalogs (see [API reference](#api-reference) below).
Documentation about *developing SwiftTUI itself* (the engineer onboarding
guide, the build/test/release process, and the known-flake register) lives in
the [`swift-tui-org` coordination repository](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-org/tree/main/docs/swift-tui)
(see [Development documentation](#development-documentation) below).

## Contents

| Document | What it covers |
| --- | --- |
| [VISION.md](VISION.md) | What SwiftTUI is for, its design principles, and what is deliberately in and out of scope. |
| [Divergences and gaps](../Sources/SwiftTUIViews/SwiftTUIViews.docc/Divergences-And-Gaps.md) | The single divergence-and-gap register (a DocC article): where the public API departs from SwiftUI and where the code at `HEAD` falls short of the API shape or the project's stated intent. |
| [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) | Modules, products, the dependency graph, source layout, layout model, and a glossary. The starting point for understanding the codebase. |
| [HOSTS-AND-PLATFORMS.md](HOSTS-AND-PLATFORMS.md) | Maintainer notes on host-code partitioning. The canonical host matrix, engine profiles, and platform support are the `Hosts-And-Platforms` DocC article. |
| [HOST-WIRE-CONTRACT.md](HOST-WIRE-CONTRACT.md) | The normative converged host-wire record, state, capability, delivery, and consumer contract at `HEAD`, including known gaps. |
| [ACCESSIBILITY.md](ACCESSIBILITY.md) | Maintainer notes on the semantic substrate: how one snapshot feeds all five host-side consumer paths. The authoring surface is documented in the `SwiftTUIViews` DocC catalog. |
| [PUBLIC-API.md](PUBLIC-API.md) | The public surface policy and inventory: what is canonical, what is package-only, and what was removed. |
| [PUBLIC_MODULE_MAP.md](PUBLIC_MODULE_MAP.md) | Generated library products, supported direct imports, public declaration owners, and conditional re-export reachability. |
| [GLOSSARY.md](GLOSSARY.md) | Framework vocabulary for architecture reviews: reconciliation/reuse, lifetimes, the cross-host wire, and the authoring seam. |
| [SOUNDNESS-ORACLES.md](SOUNDNESS-ORACLES.md) | The canonical map of reconciliation soundness probes: enforcement tier, sampling, release behavior, residual quarantine, and owning tests. |

## Development documentation

Documentation for *developing SwiftTUI itself* lives in the `swift-tui-org`
coordination repository under
[`docs/swift-tui/`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-org/tree/main/docs/swift-tui):

- [CODEBASE-GUIDE.md](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-org/blob/main/docs/swift-tui/CODEBASE-GUIDE.md):
  engineer onboarding, with a horizontal module map plus vertical end-to-end
  traces.
- [DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-org/blob/main/docs/swift-tui/DEVELOPMENT.md):
  toolchains, the build/test gate, fixture policy, and the release process.
- [KNOWN-TEST-FLAKES.md](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-org/blob/main/docs/swift-tui/KNOWN-TEST-FLAKES.md):
  the register of known, pre-existing flaky tests and how to tell a flake
  from a real regression.

## API reference

The published reference is <https://swifttui.sh/docs/documentation/>.
Per-symbol API documentation is authored as DocC catalogs alongside the source:

- `Sources/SwiftTUICore/SwiftTUICore.docc`: geometry, phase products, cell/pixel metrics.
- `Sources/SwiftTUIViews/SwiftTUIViews.docc`: authoring views, state, focus, gestures, drawing.
- `Sources/SwiftTUIRuntime/SwiftTUIRuntime.docc`: the runtime, runtime render pipeline, hosting, running apps.
- `Sources/SwiftTUIAnimatedImage/SwiftTUIAnimatedImage.docc`: animated image playback.
- `Sources/SwiftTUIProfiling/SwiftTUIProfiling.docc`: optional profiling with `.profiling()`, the `SWIFTTUI_PROFILE` grammar, and the frame/memory/CPU signals.
- `Sources/SwiftTUI/SwiftTUI.docc`: the batteries-included convenience product.

Build the combined archive with `Scripts/build_docc_archive.sh`.

## Tooling files in this folder

`docs/` also holds four machine-managed files that are **not documentation** and
are not part of this hierarchy:

- `public_api_overrides.yml`: public-symbol classifications consumed by the API tooling.
- `PUBLIC_API_BASELINE.md` and `.public-api-baseline.txt`: generated public-symbol baselines.
- `.spi-api-baseline.txt`: the generated `@_spi` surface baseline.

`Scripts/generate_public_api_inventory.sh` produces and compares them. See
[DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-org/blob/main/docs/swift-tui/DEVELOPMENT.md#public-api-baseline).
