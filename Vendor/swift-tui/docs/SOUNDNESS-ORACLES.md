# Soundness oracles

This is the canonical HEAD-state map of SwiftTUI's reconciliation and runtime
soundness probes. Each probe row is part of the implementation contract. Add
the source item first. Then add its documentation and tests. A new `record*`
function, counter, or trace kind in
[`SoundnessProbeConfiguration.swift`](../Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Resolve/SoundnessProbeConfiguration.swift)
requires three additions: a row here, a counter snapshot entry, and an owning
test.
`Scripts/check_soundness_oracle_map.sh` derives those inventories from source
and makes drift fail the repository policy phase.

## Enforcement model

- **T-fail** means any emitted trace is a gate failure. The DEBUG-only
  `assertZeroCensusViolation` subset also traps at the recording site.
- **T-ratchet** means the committed
  [`soundness_quarantine.txt`](../Scripts/soundness_quarantine.txt) pins an
  exact residual count. Growth fails. An exact baseline warns. Shrinkage
  prompts reducing the ledger. **No probe row uses it at HEAD.** The ledger has
  carried no active row since 2026-08-29, so every row in the map below is
  T-fail or T-info. The tier stays defined because the next accepted residual
  will need it, and because the layout branching ledger is enforced in this
  style.
- **T-info** records measurements rather than violations. It has no trace kind
  and cannot fail the gate by itself.

The local test gate and release soundness lane arm
`SWIFTTUI_SOUNDNESS_PROBE_TRACE`, write per-step trace files, and pass them to
[`scan_soundness_traces.sh`](../Scripts/scan_soundness_traces.sh). Serialized
test suites can also use `SoundnessCounterSnapshot` deltas for attribution.
An intentional oracle-reduction test suppresses tracing or the DEBUG assertion
window while leaving the counter path observable.

Sampling is deterministic. `sampleEveryNFrames` defaults to every frame in
DEBUG/tests and one frame in 256 in release. The release soundness lane forces
one. Rows marked **sampled frame** run only when
`isSampledFrame == true`. Rows marked **event** record every time their rare
failure or diagnostic path executes while the configuration enables the probe.

### Assertion-only oracles outside the counter map

The map below is derived from the `record*` functions in
`SoundnessProbeConfiguration`. One oracle has no recorder and therefore no row:
`RetainedFrameIndex.init(patching:with:verifyingAgainstFullRebuild:)` checks a
patched retained-frame index byte-for-byte against a full rebuild and traps with
`preconditionFailure` on divergence. It is DEBUG-only and, until 2026-08-27,
consulted no probe at all — a raw `#if DEBUG`, so every shape-stable frame in
every debug build paid for the full rebuild the patch path exists to avoid.
It now takes the sampling decision as a parameter, threaded down from the main
actor by the frame tail (the index is built on the frame-tail worker, and the
probe is main-actor state — the same hop
`Rasterizer.rasterizeCollectingVisibleIdentities(verifyIncrementalRasterDamage:)`
makes). Direct callers, which are tests, keep it on by default.

If it ever grows a counter, it belongs in the map below under the usual rule.

## Current map

Each table row carries a machine-readable `oracle-map` comment in its final
cell. Keep the comment's kind, recorder, and counter spellings exact.

The renderer repairs the mismatch before publication | Every DEBUG raster with a shadow comparison. Sampled release raster | Trace scan and serialized snapshot delta | `SoundnessProbeConfigurationTests`, `SoundnessFailureChannelTests`, raster stress fixtures | None. Repair preserves output but does not excuse the alarm  <!-- oracle-map: raster-damage ; recordRasterDamageMismatch ; rasterDamageMismatchCount --> |
| `teardown-coherence` — no committed node is over-removed | Post-finalize reachability audit in [`ViewGraph.swift`](../Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Resolve/ViewGraph.swift) | T-fail.

Leak census currency | `SoundnessProbeConfigurationTests`, `ParentDetachedKeepGuardBarrierTests`, `ReRootedControlCommittedValueAnchorTests`, `AnyViewResilienceTests`, framework lifecycle stress suites, `SoundnessFailureChannelTests` | None — burned down to zero and **unquarantined** on 2026-08-29, so any recurrence fails the scan as "is not quarantined" (67 before that day's second pass, 174 before its first, 499 before the 2026-08-28 seam-fixture anchor fix, 478 at `Program-5-S0`). The last 67 were three under-anchoring seams that each recorded a lifetime claim against a source the same frame destroyed: a parent-detached keep justified only by liveness proxies that enqueued no barrier work, an absorbed collapse-chain mint whose `hostedDetached` hosting was not transferred with its registrations, and a stale `parent` back-reference vetoing a re-rooted control's committed-value edge.

The last 64 were the publication path having no NODE axis: its reset selects registration-key identity prefixes and its restore only writes, so an entry registered under an identity outside the reset roots survived both however dead its owner was. `removeUnjustifiedRegistrations` now asks each entry's owner node whether it still records it, on both scoped paths  <!-- oracle-map: registration-publication ; recordRegistrationPublicationViolation ; registrationPublicationViolationCount --> |

An absent optional registry is outside caller scope. **No ledger row** (2026-08-28): it measured 0 on macOS and Linux from 2026-08-22 and its zero row was removed, which changes nothing about enforcement — a recurrence fails the scan as "is not quarantined" exactly as it previously failed as "exceeds baseline=0". It was temporarily quarantined at 1 on 2026-08-14 for `GestureScroll026`  <!-- oracle-map: handler-resolution-gesture ; recordInteractiveHandlerResolutionViolation ; gestureRouteResolutionViolationCount --> |

## Counter-consumer contract

A new violation class is not complete until all five pieces land together:

1. A `record*` entry point in `SoundnessProbeConfiguration`.
2. A stable kebab-case trace kind, unless the row is explicitly T-info.
3. A counter mirrored by `SoundnessCounterSnapshot`.
4. Exactly one row and `oracle-map` marker in this document.
5. A deterministic owning test. When the class emits a trace, the owning tests
   include `SoundnessFailureChannelTests`.

The policy script rejects missing, duplicate, and unknown kinds. It requires
an entry for every current recorder and counter. One recorder can serve
several kinds, as the five interactive handler families do. One class can
update combined and class-specific counters, as teardown leak does.

## Quarantined residuals (none at HEAD)

**No** kind carries a ledger row.
[`soundness_quarantine.txt`](../Scripts/soundness_quarantine.txt) has held no
active row since 2026-08-29, so every probe in the map above fails outright
rather than ratcheting. This section stays as the durable tracking reference
for the rows the ledger *has* carried: before it existed, a stage tag
(`Program-5-S0`) in that file was the only record of *why* the team quarantined
a class, and a tag names a program without explaining the reason.

The four retired rows, newest first:

| Kind | Retired | Last baseline | Why it reached zero |
| --- | --- | --: | --- |
| `teardown-coherence-leak` | 2026-08-29, second pass | 67 | Three under-anchoring seams sharing one invariant |
| `registration-publication` | 2026-08-29, first pass | 64 | The scoped publication path had no owner-node axis |
| `action-dispatch-miss` | 2026-08-28 | 1 | A deliberate negative probe, never a defect |
| `handler-resolution-gesture` | 2026-08-28 | 0 | A zero row, which the scanner enforces identically to no row |

All four kinds are back to plain `T-fail`, and a recurrence fails the scan as
"is not quarantined" — the same hard error a `count=0` row produced as "exceeds
baseline=0". A row returns only by recording a residual the team has decided to
accept for now, with its provenance written here.

### The 2026-08-29 second pass: the last row retired, and a correction

`teardown-coherence-leak` fell **67 → 0**, which empties the ledger. Three
independent fixes did it, measured in the merged tree with every run
`--no-parallel` and with identical test-count controls — the two stress suites
stay at 2 tests / 75 cases, and `AnyViewResilienceTests` moves 9 → 10 only
because fix C adds a test:

| Configuration | Stress suites | `AnyViewResilience` | Total |
| --- | --: | --: | --: |
| HEAD baseline, re-measured | 66 | 1 | 67 |
| B + C | 30 | 0 | 30 |
| B + C + A, merged | **0** | **0** | **0** |

The HEAD re-measurement reproduces the retired row's published split — 40 in
`FrameworkStressAdditional`, 26 in `FrameworkStressExpansion`, plus the one
`ScopedAnyViewButton` line — so the 67 burned down here is the 67 the row
pinned.

**A lifetime claim recorded against a source that the same frame destroys is
not a claim.** All three fixes arrived at that sentence independently from
three different seams. It is also the shape of the first pass below
(`dafc72e3`: an entity home is not a durable lifetime owner), and it is the
standing lesson of the day.

**B — a keep justified by a liveness proxy owes the barrier a verdict.**
[`ViewGraphSubtreeRemoval.swift`](../Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Resolve/ViewGraphSubtreeRemoval.swift)'s
parent-detached keep-guard spared a node when it owned
`nodeIDByIdentity[node.identity]` or `[node.resolvedIdentity]`, or was an entity
route's home — and, unlike the visited-descendant spare directly above it,
enqueued no barrier work at all. The node landed in `walk.enteredNodeIDs`; the
same departing source's relation-target loop then severed `parent`,
`committedValue`, and `hostedDetached`, and skipped it as already entered,
leaving it stored with `anchors=[]` and unreachable. Such a keep now calls
`enqueueTeardownWork(.sparedVisitedDescent, …)` and hands the verdict to the
teardown barrier, whose criterion *is* the leak census's criterion — so
deferring cannot over-remove. A keep justified by a durable anchor outside the
cascade still returns unchanged. `ParentDetachedKeepGuardBarrierTests` pins
both directions, and its reclaim test fails on all three assertions with the
enqueue neutered. 66 → 30.

**C — hosting must transfer with a reclaim, not just registrations.** A
transparent collapse chain hosts each level on the one above it, so an interior
mint's `hostedDetached` edge is the only structural anchor its surviving
content has. `pruneAbsorbedShadowedNodes` reclaimed that mint as a shadow while
the content itself was spared as visited-this-frame, and re-homed the shadow's
runtime *registrations* while leaving its lifetime *anchor* behind. The new
`adoptAbsorbedDetachedHostedRoots(from:)` in
[`ViewGraphChainCollapse.swift`](../Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Resolve/ViewGraphChainCollapse.swift)
runs immediately after `adoptAbsorbedRuntimeRegistrations(from:)` and transfers
hosting, guarded on `visitedThisFrame` — an unvisited target is genuinely
departing and the cascade must still reach it. The shape is cold-render only
and invisible from frame 2. Its forensic signature —
`anchors=[entityHome(X)] parent=nil evalHost=nil`, visited this frame, entity
route still **present** — is what separates it from retired shape (a), where
the route was gone. Pinned by
`AnyViewResilienceTests.scopedAnyViewContentKeepsALifetimeAnchorWhenItsHostIsAbsorbed`.
This is the "plus one `ScopedAnyViewButton` line" the retired row never
assigned to either named shape: it belonged to neither.

**A — a stale back-reference is not evidence of non-adjacency.** This one is an
**under-anchoring** bug on the arriving side rather than an under-removal bug,
and it carried the larger half of the count.
`replaceCommittedValueAnchors(in:)` in
[`ViewGraphLifetimeRelation.swift`](../Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/Resolve/ViewGraphLifetimeRelation.swift)
proved a stamped node's adjacency to `nearestStampedAncestor` through
`stampedNode.parent?.viewNodeID == nearestStampedAncestor`. An
`.id(_:)`-re-rooted control keeps a stale `parent` back-reference to the
generation that last committed it; once that generation departs the reference
names an unstored object, the adjacency test rejects, and **no** committed-value
edge is projected at all. That leaves a live control — visited, index-owning,
route-owning, present in the accepted committed value tree — anchored by
nothing but an entity home the census refuses to seed, and takes its whole
`ButtonBody` styling island with it. Membership in the accepted committed value
tree is now the claim, and a stale back-reference no longer vetoes it (11
lines). `ReRootedControlCommittedValueAnchorTests` pins it and was verified
failing (`rc=1`, 8 trace lines) with the fix neutered. It **requires** fix B to
be present. 30 → 0.

**Not a false zero.** Reverting only A returned 30 and restoring it returned 0,
both in freshly built binaries. No other soundness kind emitted a single line
at HEAD or merged, and the zero-tolerance over-removal oracles —
`teardown-coherence`, `stranded-listing`, `teardown-barrier-non-convergence` —
stayed at 0 throughout, which is the control that says these fixes removed
leaks rather than trading them for over-removals. `SwiftTUIGraphTests` passes
487 tests in 69 suites.

One candidate fix was written and then **reverted as redundant**: having
`releaseInactiveEntityRoutes` drop the last claim post-barrier in
`ViewGraphEntityRouting.swift`. Fix B removes the same nodes upstream and
strictly dominates it, because B also catches nodes whose entity stays
**active**, which a `!activeEntities.contains(entity)` predicate structurally
cannot express.

#### Correcting the record on shapes (a) and (b)

The retired row named two shapes. They were **one mechanism seen from opposite
ends**, and the published description of (b) was **wrong**. That is worth
saying plainly, because this document's own standing lesson is that these
descriptions get trusted later by someone who cannot cheaply re-derive them.

(b) was published as `ViewGraphSubtreeRemoval` stripping every `hostedDetached`
edge in one bulk pass *before* the pass that decides whether to spare each
target, with the prescribed remedy of moving the strip inside that decision.
Neither half held. Forensic instrumentation showed the anchors were emptied by
the relation-target `removeRemovalEdges` pass, not by the bulk strip. And the
prescribed remedy was applied **experimentally and changed nothing**:
`removeRemovalEdges` takes the edge a few statements later and `removeNode`
follows behind it. No ordering of the strip can save a target whose host is
deleted in the same cascade. What closed both shapes was B — the missing
barrier enqueue — with A for the re-rooted arrivals underneath them.

#### A latent divergence, found and left open

`pruneSparedVisitedDescentStrands` builds its reachability context **without**
zeroing `liveEntityHomeByIdentity`, while `lifetimeReachabilitySnapshot` zeroes
it explicitly. A node anchored by nothing but an entity home is therefore judged
**reachable** by the barrier and **unreachable** by the census — the same "two
passes disagree about what an entity home means" class that `dafc72e3` closed in
`closeResolveLifetimeScope` in the first pass below. Fix A removed the
population that exercised it, so it measures nothing at HEAD, but the divergence
itself remains. Naively zeroing the barrier's seeds would reclaim genuinely live
nodes, so closing it needs a real distinction rather than a one-line change.
Recorded here so the next reader who trips over it does not have to rediscover
it.

### The 2026-08-29 first pass: a missing invariant, not a missing measurement

`registration-publication` fell **64 → 0** and `teardown-coherence-leak`
**174 → 67**. Unlike the previous burn-down these were real defects, and the
lane coverage control says so: the sharded runtime lane reported
`178 / 834 / 2362` tests before and after, so nothing moved through coverage.

**An owner key must name the live node whose record justifies the entry.** The
scoped publication had no node axis at all. Its reset
(`removeSubtrees(rootedAt:)`) selects registration-**key** identity prefixes;
its restore selects **nodes** and only ever writes. An entry registered under an
identity outside the reset roots is therefore unreachable from both, however
dead it is — and a full rebuild has no such gap, because it resets and then
republishes from live node records only. The whole measured population was that
one hole, in two shapes:

- **58 stacked duplicates** (`live=2 rebuilt=1`): an `.id(_:)`-re-rooted control
  — `TextField(…).id(FocusContextFirstTitle)` and the ScrollView indicator trio
  — holds its registration identity fixed while its registering node re-mints.
  The key registry buckets handlers per contributing owner, so the departed
  node's bucket survived the reset and the arriving node's bucket landed beside
  it. The diagnostic that settled it read
  `node=ViewNodeID(1012)/live=false | node=ViewNodeID(1034)/live=true` under one
  identity.
- **6 stale survivors** (`live=1 rebuilt=0`): a still-**live** owner that
  stopped recording a registration it once made. Its record is empty
  (`declares=false`), so the rebuild produces nothing — the live entry is a
  handler still dispatchable that no rebuild can re-derive.

`removeUnjustifiedRegistrations` closes both: on the publication path each entry
asks its owner node whether it still records that registration, and a departed
owner resolves to nil, which withdraws everything it owned. It reaches the
owner-keyed families that hold no interaction state — the key registry and
everything on `IdentityKeyedRegistryStorage`. The pointer/gesture/gesture-state
trio deliberately does not implement it: their node-liveness cleanup is
`pruneOrphanedGestures` followed by `RunLoop.processFocusSyncIteration`'s
paired-region pass, and that ordering is load-bearing (F101). It runs for
**both** scoped paths — the `.subtrees` branch and the fingerprint-delta body,
which also restores scoped and carried the last 10 divergences after the first
fix.

That fix has a prerequisite. `NodeHandlers.rehomeAdoptedOwners` now runs for
**every** owner-keyed family on adoption, where it previously ran for the
gesture family alone. Adoption transfers ownership of a departing node's
records, and an owner key left naming the absorbed node makes a live, adopted
registration read as stale — the exact hazard the gesture rehome was written to
prevent, spelled out in its own comment. It is joined to the `allRecordFields`
totality fold, so a family cannot gain an owner map and skip the rehome
silently.

**An entity home is not a durable lifetime owner.** Two passes disagreed about
what an entity route means, and the disagreement was the whole
`teardown-coherence-leak` strand root. `closeResolveLifetimeScope` counted
`.entityHome` as a durable anchor and therefore skipped recording the
`hostedDetached` anchor a detached mint otherwise gets; the reachability census
refuses to seed entity homes at all (`LifetimeRelationCensus` zeroes
`liveEntityHomeByIdentity` — "entity routes qualify local teardown decisions;
they do not turn a detached node into a committed-root census seed"). A dropped
`ForEach`/`List` element always carries an entity route, so its **only** lifetime
claim was one the census does not accept — and `releaseInactiveEntityRoutes`
withdraws that claim at the frame barrier as soon as the entity goes inactive or
its home leaves the live set. Instrumenting which call site emptied each
strand root's anchor set returned a single answer, 72 times out of 72:
`releaseInactiveEntityRoutes`. Entity homes are no longer durable, so these
elements take the host anchor the census does honour, and the RC-3 supersession
sweep retires them once the declaring host stops re-declaring them.

**A mint made off the resolve stack is anchored by nobody.** The late-preference
toolbar reconcile (`Toolbar.swift`) runs outside any `resolveView` call, so
`ResolveLifetimeScopeContext.current` is nil and every node it minted —
`…/toolbar-scope` and its interior — was reported to no scope and left with no
anchor at all (`emptiedBy=never`). It now reinstalls its declaring host around
the reconcile, exactly as delayed indexed-child realization already does for its
own out-of-stack mints.

Standing lesson from this pass, alongside the two from 2026-08-28: when two
passes read the same fact, **check that they agree on what it means**. Both
halves here were one pass treating a claim as durable that another pass had
already decided was not a lifetime root at all.

### The 2026-08-28 burn-down: two whole classes were measurement artifacts

`registration-publication` fell 1,199 → 64 and `teardown-coherence-leak`
499 → 174 with no change to any reconciliation, teardown, or publication
behaviour. Neither move was coverage: the runtime shard that carried 995 of the
1,199 reported the identical `834 tests in 35 suites` before and after, and the
graph lane moved 480 → 482 only because this change added two tests. Both were
the measuring apparatus being wrong about what it measured,
and the two failure shapes are worth naming because nothing in a green gate
distinguishes them from real defects.

**The oracle and its subject were not comparable.** `RuntimeRegistrationSet`'s
fifteen member registries are all `Optional`, and `allRegistries` is a
`compactMap` over them — a host installs the registries it needs. The F04
publication oracle built its comparison scratch with
`RuntimeRegistrationSet.scratch()`, which unconditionally constructs all
fifteen. A bare `ResolveContext` — every `DefaultRenderer` stress render —
installs none, so on those frames the oracle compared an **empty** live target
against a fully populated rebuild and reported every registration the graph
held as `live=0 rebuilt=1`. That was 995 of the runtime lane's 1,199, and no
scoped restore was ever at fault: publishing into a registry the target does
not have is a no-op by construction, so there is nothing there for a scoped
restore to get wrong. The scratch now mirrors the target's membership
(`RuntimeRegistrationSet.scratch(mirroringMembershipOf:)`), which leaves the
oracle strict over every registry that exists and silent about the ones that
cannot hold anything. `RuntimeRegistrationRestoreScopingTests`'
`sparseLiveTargetDoesNotTripPublicationOracle` pins it; the existing phantom
test still proves the oracle fires on a genuine divergence.

**The fixture did not model the shape it claimed to.** All 325 of the graph
lane's leaks came from `RuntimeRegistrationRestoreScopingTests`' generated seam
cases. Those cases seed capture-island nodes — `PortalIsland`, `OverlayIsland`,
`LazyTabIsland`, `SheetCapturedIsland`, `LazyViewportIsland`,
`IdentityRerootIsland` — that are deliberately committed in no children array,
exactly as a lazy tab body or a presentation-portal attachment is. In the
framework such a node is kept alive by the `hostedDetached` anchor its host's
resolve-lifetime scope records (`ResolveLifetimeScope.swift`). The fixture
drives `beginEvaluation` directly and recorded no anchor, so every island
landed with `anchors=[] parent=nil evalHost=nil hosted=none` and the
finalize-barrier census was correct to call it unreachable. The fixture now
anchors each island to its declaring sibling host. **The census was right; the
fixture was unfaithful** — and a fixture that omits the very anchor whose
absence the census exists to detect will always read as a leak.

The two count=1-class rows were the same kind of error at smaller scale.
`action-dispatch-miss` was one deliberate negative probe: `DormantTabStateTests`
asserted `!actions.dispatch(...)` to prove a dormant payload had dropped its
registration, and the alarm fires on a lookup **miss** — so it fired precisely
when that assertion **passed**. (The ledger described it as burning down "with
its already-failing test"; the test was not failing, and could not have been.)
The assertion now reads `hasHandler`, which is alarm-free and is also what the
assertion claims to test — `dispatch` conflates "no handler" with "handler
returned `false`". `handler-resolution-gesture` had measured 0 on both platforms
since 2026-08-22 and was held as a zero row "so a recurrence fails"; a
recurrence already failed either way, so the row bought a `WARNING` line and the
false implication that the class was a formally accepted defect.

Standing lesson, alongside the coverage one below: before treating a
quarantined count as a defect population, check that the **oracle and its
comparison subject are actually comparable**, and that the **fixture models the
production shape it claims to**. Coverage is not the only way these numbers lie.

Both new figures are confirmed on two platforms — a full macOS `bun run test`
and the arm64 Linux container lane in worktree source mode each report 64 and
174 exactly — which the 2026-08-14 pair never were.

The scan on that day (superseded by the two 2026-08-29 passes above, which
retired both rows):

```
WARNING: registration-publication count=64 matches baseline=64
WARNING: teardown-coherence-leak count=174 matches baseline=174
PASS: soundness trace counts are within their exact quarantine baselines
```

### These counts are coverage-sensitive — read this before calling one a regression

A count measures violations *observed*, so it scales with how much of the suite
actually ran. A lane that dies partway makes every downstream figure read low,
and the next person to record a baseline writes that low number down. This has
now happened twice, from two different causes:

1. **2026-08-14, deadlock.** The runtime lane was hanging and dying to the
   1200s watchdog, so traces after that suite went unobserved. Fixing it moved
   `registration-publication` 1194 → 1216 and `teardown-coherence-leak`
   478 → 497, and first surfaced `action-dispatch-miss` and
   `handler-resolution-gesture` at 1 each.
2. **2026-08-14, crash.** The figures from (1) were *themselves* truncated. A
   test subscripted past the end of a raster row after a failed bounds
   `#expect`, so a failing assertion killed the test process and aborted the
   lane. Before that fix no run with ≥1000 tests completed at all; after it the
   lane reports 3247 tests in 357 suites, and the honest figures are 1237 and
   499.

Neither move was a new defect — in both cases the only change was to test code.
Before treating a moved count as a regression, ask whether lane coverage
changed. Two cheap checks: `grep` the gate log for
`exited with unexpected signal`, and compare the runtime lane's reported test
total against a known-good run.

An unguarded subscript after a bounds `#expect` is the specific hazard: Swift
Testing's `#expect` does not stop execution, so the next line runs anyway and
one failing test becomes a lane-wide coverage hole.

### A parallel `swift test` reports ZERO for every kind — read this too

Coverage truncation makes a count read low. This one erases it.
`SoundnessProbeConfiguration.isSampledFrame` is a **process global**, latched by
`beginFrame`. Under a parallel `swift test` the interleaved graphs clobber each
other's sampling decision, and the scan then reports **zero** trace lines for
every kind — including against a HEAD whose true count was 67. Only
`--no-parallel` reproduces a ledger figure.

This is what the runtime lane's serialization requirement
([`check_serialized_execution.sh`](../Scripts/check_serialized_execution.sh))
protects, and it is why a casual re-measurement outside the gate is worse than
no measurement: it does not read low, it reads clean. A re-measure that returns
zero across *every* kind at once is showing you its launch, not the code.

### What a green scan does and does not prove

Other documents describe the ledger as "exact-count". Read that carefully,
because the enforcement is **asymmetric**
([`scan_soundness_traces.sh`](../Scripts/scan_soundness_traces.sh)):

| Observed vs baseline | Verdict |
| --- | --- |
| `actual > baseline` | **FAIL** — growth is a hard error |
| `actual == baseline` | WARNING, "matches baseline" |
| `actual < baseline` | WARNING, "reduce the ledger" |
| any count with no ledger row | **FAIL** — "is not quarantined" |

So the baseline is a **ceiling with a shrink nudge**, not an assertion of the
current count. A green scan proves `actual ≤ baseline`. It does *not* prove
`actual == baseline`. A baseline left too high after a fix produces only a
warning. People can miss a warning in a passing gate.

**Do not treat a green gate as evidence that these numbers are current.** A
`> 0` count with no row fails the gate. This rule stops the system from silently
absorbing a *new* kind.

### Reconciliation with the S0 findings census (2026-07-30)

The S0 findings report and this ledger disagree, and the disagreement is
expected rather than a defect. The report is a **pre-S1** census. The ledger is
**post-S1**:

The S0 columns below are a **dated snapshot** and are kept as history. Only the
last column is current:

| Kind | S0 raw | S0 injected | S0 residual | Ledger post-S1 | Measured 2026-07-30 | 2026-08-14 | 2026-08-22 | 2026-08-28 | 2026-08-29 pass 1 | **Ledger and measured 2026-08-29 pass 2** |
| --- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| `registration-publication` | 1,197 | 1 | 1,196 | 1194 | 1122 | 1237 | 1194 | 64 | 0 | **0 (unquarantined)** |
| `teardown-coherence-leak` | 479 | 1 | 478 | 478 | 478 | 499 | 499 | 174 | 67 | **0 (unquarantined)** |

Read that 2026-07-30 column as a *floor observed under partial coverage*, not as
a truth the later figures contradict. `registration-publication`'s apparent
drop to 1122 and its later rise to 1237 are the same phenomenon seen from two
sides: how much of the runtime lane completed on the day of the measurement.
See the coverage-sensitivity note above for the two truncations involved. The
2026-08-22 move back to 1194 is a genuine burn-down, not coverage: the lane
completed on both platforms, and the 43 residuals were the toolbar strip
shrinking under a frontier-scoped plan (its departed item's registration
survived the scoped reset until the host next applied); the strip now
schedules a host follow-up frame.

S1's scoped-restore suppression is the one genuine movement of the pre-2026-08-28
columns: it changed the S0 report's 1,196 to the ledger's 1194, which the ledger
row recorded as "post-suppression scoped-restore residual".

The 2026-08-28 column is a different kind of movement again, and the largest:
neither coverage nor a reconciliation fix, but two measurement artifacts being
removed from the apparatus — see the 2026-08-28 burn-down section above. Read
every earlier column as a population that was mostly not defects.

The two 2026-08-29 columns are the fourth kind, and the only one so far that
is neither coverage nor apparatus: genuine reconciliation fixes against a
population that really was defects. That is why both kinds reach zero rather
than a smaller residual — in each case a missing invariant was supplied, not a
miscount corrected. Pass 2 emptied the ledger.

**No document here is the authority. Only a fresh trace-armed full-gate run
is.** The S0 report is a dated snapshot and is not maintained. The ledger is a
ceiling; read it as "what will fail the gate", not "what is true". A standalone
`scan_soundness_traces.sh` is not a substitute either — it reads whatever
`.build/soundness-trace` has accumulated from ad-hoc `swift test` runs and
reports inflated counts, whereas a full `bun run test` clears that directory
first.

## Layout branching ledger

[`Scripts/layout_branching_ledger.txt`](../Scripts/layout_branching_ledger.txt)
is a ratchet in this document's T-ratchet style, but it is a **layout work
metric**, not a graph probe: it has no `SoundnessProbeConfiguration` recorder,
no trace kind, and no oracle-map row. Each ledger row pins a ceiling on the
child-measure-requests-per-container-computation ratio (milli-units) that one
`BranchingFactorOracleTests` fixture measures, split built-in vs custom
(plan 2026-08-11-004 Stage 0). The counters live in
`LayoutBranchingMetrics` (`Sources/SwiftTUICore/Commit/FrameMetrics.swift`)
and ride the frame diagnostic record into the TSV sinks.

Enforcement mirrors the trace scanner's asymmetry: a measured ratio above its
ceiling fails, an exact match passes as "matches baseline", below-baseline
passes with a "reduce the ledger" warning on stderr. CI never rewrites the
ledger; reductions are manual commits. The suite also fails on drift in
either direction between the ledger's rows and its own fixture coverage, so
a row cannot silently outlive (or predate) its fixture. A request is counted
at its issue site and still counts when a cache or retained serve answers
it — the ledger pins *shape*; cache warmth changes cost, which the unledgered
computation counters report separately.

## Known blind spots and scoping debt

The probe state remains process-global `@MainActor` storage. Concurrent graphs
interleave sampling decisions, counters, details, and trace lines. Snapshot
deltas are therefore safe for attribution only in serialized suites. The trace
scan is the cross-suite verdict, not a claim of per-test ownership.
We defer per-`ViewGraph` scoping until multi-scene hosting makes that
architecture real.

The `layout-shadow-divergence` row closes the former measure/place blind spot:
on a sampled frame the tail's layout stage re-runs measure and place with every
reuse tier disabled (no measurement cache, no retained session) and pair-walks
the production trees against the fresh ones on identity, `measuredSize`, and
placed `bounds`, without repairing the production value before recording. Its
measured holes are deliberate and there are exactly two. First, subtrees under
a windowed lazy or hosted product are skipped, because the production window
stride is a running refinement the cold shadow pass legitimately cannot
reproduce; each skip counts into `layoutShadowWindowedExclusionCount`. Second,
a frame whose SHADOW pass hits the engine re-entry depth budget is skipped
whole and counted into `layoutShadowDepthExclusionCount`: the all-fresh shadow
consumes strictly more re-entry depth than a production pass whose serve tiers
skip interior descents, so at the budget boundary the shadow truncates
(`layout.customLayoutDepthLimitExceeded`) geometry production legitimately
computed — the 2026-08-11 mrkdwn examples-gate false alarm, pinned by the
depth-asymmetry red proof in `LayoutShadowOracleTests`. Both holes are
fresh-pass-definition boundaries, not comparison bugs; if a THIRD carve-out
ever seems necessary, treat it as a design smell to revisit, not a routine
expansion.

Two resolve-domain inputs are part of the fresh-pass definition rather than
the carve-out. First, the scratch context is seeded with the production
pass's layout-dependent realizations and never realizes live: realization
resolves authored content against the live graph — reading and writing it —
and is not idempotent within a frame (the first realization's entity commits
change what a second one resolves), so realized children are input to the
fresh pass exactly as the resolved tree is, and the observe-only contract
holds by construction. Second, the scratch context carries the production
session as `measurementSeedSession`, consumed only by the custom-layout
hysteresis-seeding seam (`RetainedMeasurementSeedableLayout`). The scroll
indicator gutter is bistable by design — a confirmed seed keeps the previous
frame's fixed point as anti-flicker hysteresis — so an unseeded shadow would
re-decide knife-edge content and report a legitimate fixed-point difference as
a divergence. Seeding is sound where stride seeding was not: the seam's
contract verifies every derived seed against fresh in-pass measurement, so a
seeded shadow still recomputes all geometry and still catches every unsound
product serve. What it deliberately does not police is the seed-verification
logic itself; a layout that trusts an unverified seed needs its own owning
test.

Equality remains an open-ended audit family. When you add a field to an
enumerated payload comparator, update its equivalence contract and adversarial
test together. Otherwise, the comparator can produce a false-equal reuse
decision. The current map
covers the memo-content and stamp consequences that reach existing probes. It
does not turn the absence of a payload-specific row into proof of coverage.

## Implementation pitfall: stranded-listing identity spaces

The stranded-listing implementation must compare **objects**, not names from
mixed identity systems. `identityByNodeID` describes nodes in
`resolvedIdentity` space, while `ViewNode.identity` and `parent.identity` are
authored-space names. Comparing those maps manufactured 13 to 14 apparent
co-listings on a healthy graph. `ViewGraphStrandedListingProbe.swift` instead
tests `child.parent !== node`, the same object relation the upward staleness
walk follows.
