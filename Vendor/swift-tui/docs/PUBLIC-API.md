# Public API

`SignalReader` accepts the framework-owned `TerminalSignal` value from
`SwiftTUIPlatformIO`. Signal names and native POSIX numbers are unchanged.
`SwiftTUIVendorUnixSignals.UnixSignal` remains a re-exported compatibility
alias to that same value, including for explicitly typed arrays. Consumers
need no conversion; the public reader signature no longer depends on a
vendored type identity. This source compatibility does not promise binary
ABI compatibility for precompiled Swift modules.

This document defines the shape of SwiftTUI's public surface. It identifies the
canonical app-facing API, package-only API, removed API, and policies for
consistent new API.

A machine-generated enumeration of every public symbol lives in
`PUBLIC_API_BASELINE.md` (grouped) and `.public-api-baseline.txt` (flat). The
`.spi-api-baseline.txt` file separately tracks the `@_spi` surface. Its most
important part is `@_spi(Runners)`, the host contract for the swiftui/web/android
host repos; `@_spi(StyleFixtures)` is the style-library testing contract (the
fixture initializers on every style configuration and captured slot;
presentation values keep ordinary public initializers because styles
construct them — see the `Testing-Styles` DocC article). Thus, an SPI
break creates a reviewable diff instead of a silent downstream failure. The inventory script generates and compares all
three symbol files and the [product and module map](PUBLIC_MODULE_MAP.md):
`Scripts/generate_public_api_inventory.sh`; see
[DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-org/blob/main/docs/swift-tui/DEVELOPMENT.md#public-api-baseline). Those files answer "is
symbol X public?". This document explains when to use a symbol and why it has
its current shape.

The generated map distinguishes library products (SwiftPM dependency choices)
from modules (declaration owners and Swift import names). External packages may
directly import the root modules of their selected library products. In
particular, `SwiftTUIViews` supports reusable view libraries and `SwiftTUIRuntime`
supports runtime/host composition; both expose the required lower-layer public
vocabulary through re-exports. `SwiftTUICore`, `SwiftTUIGraph`,
`SwiftTUIPrimitives`, `SwiftTUITerminalCLI`, `SwiftTUICLIAttach`, and
`SwiftTUIPlatformIO` have no standalone library product. Their presence in a
consumer's transitive build graph does not establish a supported direct import.
Symbol classifications still govern API use, and SPI remains a separate contract.

## The one authoring story

`SwiftTUIRuntime.HotReloadExport` is a debug-only macOS/Linux development API.
Its generic `retainedRoot` factory creates the owned payload for the terminal
`swifttui-dev` loader without exposing `AnyView`. It is absent from release and
WASI builds. See the [compiled reload guide](../Sources/SwiftTUIRuntime/SwiftTUIRuntime.docc/Compiled-Hot-Reload.md)
for the C export, ownership, dependency boundaries and diagnostic resets.

The package presents a single primary authoring story: write views with the
SwiftUI-shaped surface on `View`; use `SwiftTUI` for one-import apps and
`SwiftTUIRuntime` for platform-neutral runtime composition; treat
`SwiftTUICore` as pipeline and data-model infrastructure. The consumer-facing
walkthrough of this decision is the published DocC article
[Choosing-Modules-And-Platforms.md](../Sources/SwiftTUI/SwiftTUI.docc/Choosing-Modules-And-Platforms.md);
do not restate it here. The policy: anything outside that shape has to justify
being public.

## The canonical surface

The canonical public surface is the API ordinary app code uses first:

- `View` and the SwiftUI-shaped containers, controls, and leaves. These include
  `VStack`, `HStack`, `ZStack`, `ScrollView`, `List`, `Table`, `OutlineGroup`,
  `NavigationStack`, `TabView`, and `Button`. They also include `Toggle`,
  `Slider`, `TextField`, `TextEditor`, `Picker`, `Text`, `Image`, and the rest.
- Property wrappers and environment plumbing: `@State`, `@Binding`,
  `@Environment`, `@FocusState`, `@FocusedValue`, `@FocusedBinding`, and the
  repo-owned `@Bindable`. Custom wrappers conform to `DynamicProperty`
  through its
  `update(in:) -> DynamicPropertyUpdateResult` contract. The context carries
  a lifetime-scoped invalidation lease for asynchronous storage, and the
  result explicitly certifies or denies reuse. The complete authoring contract
  lives in the DocC article
  [Custom-Dynamic-Properties.md](../Sources/SwiftTUIViews/SwiftTUIViews.docc/Custom-Dynamic-Properties.md).
- The modifier algebra: `ViewModifier`, `View.modifier(_:)`, `ModifiedContent`,
  and the canonical identity/layout/styling/presentation modifiers.
- Runtime integration in `SwiftTUIRuntime`: `DefaultRenderer`, `RunLoop`,
  `RuntimeConfiguration`, `App`, `Scene`, `WindowGroup`, the scene builder
  artifacts, `RenderSnapshot`, `HostedSceneSession`, `HostedRasterSurface`,
  `SemanticHostFrame`, and the `PresentationSurface` roles.
- The default animated-image surface from `SwiftTUIAnimatedImage`. Charting
  ships separately from
  [`swift-tui-charts`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-charts).

Document a feature on this surface first when the surface can express it.

### The value-type conformance guard

`View`, `ViewModifier`, `DynamicProperty`, `Scene`, `App`, and every
body-producing style protocol (`ButtonStyle`, `TextFieldStyle`, `PickerStyle`,
`ToggleStyle`, `LabelStyle`, `LabeledContentStyle`, `GroupBoxStyle`,
`ControlGroupStyle`, `MenuStyle`, `DisclosureGroupStyle`, `SliderStyle`,
`StepperStyle`, `ProgressViewStyle`, `TextEditorStyle`, `TabViewStyle`, and
`PaletteStyle`) each declare one
underscored static requirement — `_viewValueTypeWitness` and its per-protocol
siblings — defaulted on the unconstrained protocol extension and
`@available(*, unavailable)` on the `Self: AnyObject` extension. A class
conformer therefore fails to compile with a message naming the invariant;
value-type conformers never see it, and it is never called.

They are the first underscored requirements on `View` and its siblings.
`Gesture` already carries two — `_makeRecognizer` and `_needsPointerCapture`
— but those are real authoring hooks that a primitive gesture implements.
The value-type witnesses are the opposite: package-owned conformance guards
that no conformer ever implements, and that exist only to *reject* a shape.
They are on the public surface only because the requirement must be visible
to a conforming module — checklist item 4 below cannot be answered "yes".
Underscored members do not reach `docs/.public-api-baseline.txt` (the symbol
graph omits them), so the baseline cannot police this surface. `Scripts/check_public_surface_policies.sh` holds
the `View` protocol to an allowlist so a second underscored requirement
cannot land unreviewed, and `Scripts/check_value_type_invariant.sh` compiles
a class conformer per protocol to prove each diagnostic still fires. The
rationale and the invariant's consequences are the *Views, modifiers,
styles, dynamic properties, scenes, and apps must be value types* entry in
[Divergences-And-Gaps.md](../Sources/SwiftTUIViews/SwiftTUIViews.docc/Divergences-And-Gaps.md).

The framework intentionally exposes neither `NavigationLink` nor an
environment dismiss command. The published rationale is the "Principled
Omissions" section of the DocC article
[Vision.md](../Sources/SwiftTUIRuntime/SwiftTUIRuntime.docc/Vision.md).

## Actor isolation model

The authoring surface is honestly isolated. The package does not suppress the
concurrency checker, and it forbids `@unchecked Sendable` and
`nonisolated(unsafe)`: shared mutable state uses explicit isolation,
`Sendable` constraints, or `Synchronization` primitives. The consumer-facing
description of the isolation model lives in the DocC article
[Authoring-Views.md](../Sources/SwiftTUIViews/SwiftTUIViews.docc/Authoring-Views.md).
New public API must follow it: authoring protocols and `body` evaluation are
`@MainActor`, and callback-bearing APIs declare their isolation explicitly
rather than inheriting it accidentally.

## AnyView Policy

`AnyView` is part of the supported surface as a narrow type-erasure escape
hatch. It is not the default authoring model.

- Prefer typed `@ViewBuilder` closures and generic `Content: View` storage.
- `AnyView` is type-aware in the retained graph: the same erased static payload
  type preserves the payload subtree. A changed payload type replaces it
  through normal structural removal.
- Public APIs must not expose `[AnyView]`, builder closures returning
  `AnyView`, or direct node-erasure construction seams.
- Internal `AnyView` storage is acceptable only for heterogeneous child
  storage, deferred authored-content capture, or local branch unification.
- Deferred authored content must be captured with `scopedAnyView(...)`, not
  plain `AnyView(...)`, so dynamic-property scope and identity-bound state stay
  correct.
- A file that stores `AnyView`, `[AnyView]`, or a closure returning `AnyView`
  must carry a nearby `AnyView policy:` comment explaining why typed storage is
  not practical there. This is enforced by
  `Scripts/check_public_surface_policies.sh`.

`AnyScene` is the scene-layer equivalent, with the same rule: prefer typed
`@SceneBuilder` composition and generic `WindowGroup<Content>` storage.

## Styling

Semantic styling is the preferred model: views write semantic style roles, and
a host-owned `Theme` resolves them to concrete colors. `Theme` is not part of
the `View` authoring surface. The `View` surface no longer includes the old
public string-style helpers or the public `Theme` shims.

Authoring-facing control and container style APIs converge on public,
extensible style protocols rather than closed public enums.

### Authoring style families

- **Protocol-backed style families today** are `ShapeStyle`, `ToolbarStyle`,
  `ButtonStyle`, `TextFieldStyle`, `PickerStyle`, `ListStyle`, `OutlineStyle`,
  `TableStyle`, `SpinnerStyle`, `SheetStyle`, `ToastStyle`, `TabViewStyle`,
  `LabelStyle`, `LabeledContentStyle`, `GroupBoxStyle`, `ToggleStyle`,
  `DisclosureGroupStyle`, `TextEditorStyle`, `ProgressViewStyle`, `SliderStyle`,
  `StepperStyle`, `MenuStyle`, `ControlGroupStyle`, `PromptStyle`,
  `FullScreenCoverStyle`, `PopoverStyle`, `PaletteStyle`, `ScrollViewStyle`,
  and `LinkStyle`.
- **Type-erased style storage** provides concrete values where environment or
  modifier plumbing needs a non-generic stored style. The types are
  `AnyShapeStyle`, `AnyButtonStyle`, `AnyTextFieldStyle`, `AnyPickerStyle`,
  `AnyListStyle`, `AnyOutlineStyle`, `AnyTableStyle`, `AnySpinnerStyle`,
  `AnySheetStyle`, `AnyToolbarStyle`, `AnyToastStyle`, `AnyTabViewStyle`,
  `AnyLabelStyle`, `AnyLabeledContentStyle`, `AnyGroupBoxStyle`, `AnyToggleStyle`,
  `AnyDisclosureGroupStyle`, `AnyTextEditorStyle`, `AnyProgressViewStyle`,
  `AnySliderStyle`, `AnyStepperStyle`, `AnyMenuStyle`, `AnyControlGroupStyle`,
  `AnyPromptStyle`, `AnyFullScreenCoverStyle`, `AnyPopoverStyle`, `AnyPaletteStyle`,
  `AnyScrollViewStyle`, and `AnyLinkStyle`.
- Built-in styles are concrete values conforming to those protocols.
- `TabViewStyle` is a full-body container style. Styles receive routeable tab
  item configurations, a routeable overflow trigger, routeable overflow item
  configurations, presentation metadata, and an active-content placeholder.
  Built-in tab styles are implemented through those same public hooks.
- New public enum-backed authoring `*Style` surfaces should not be added. Do not
  restore removed enum-backed style families as shims.

## Geometry, pointer, and Canvas

Public naming keeps coordinate roles visible:

- `Cell*` names (`CellPoint`, `CellSize`, `CellRect`) for the integer
  terminal grid that layout, semantic bounds, and raster output use.
- `Point`, `Size`, `Rect`, and `Vector` for continuous cell-space geometry
  delivered to gestures, hover, `Canvas` drawing, and interpolation.
- `Pixel*` only for host/device-pixel provenance.

`PointerLocation`, `PointerInputCapabilities`, and `CellPixelMetrics` describe
input quality without changing the layout contract. Cell-only fallback is
always supported. `Canvas` is the public arbitrary-drawing escape hatch:
prefer value drawings conforming to `CanvasDrawing` for stable structural
equality. The closure-backed `Canvas { ... }` compares by identity.

## Action scopes and commands

The full ActionScope/commands surface is public:

- `ActionScope` (with `AnyID`) and `CommandRegistry`.
- `Panel<ID, Content>` plus `.panel(id:)` and `.panel()`.
- `.keyCommand(...)` with shallowest-wins dispatch along the focus chain.
  Modifier-less bindings are framework-reserved.
- `.paletteCommand(...)`, contentless `.paletteSheet(...)`, and `.paletteStyle(...)`.
  `PaletteStyleConfiguration` supplies opaque command identities, public pointer
  routes, guarded activation, and coordinated dismissal.
- `.toolbar()`, `.toolbarStyle(...)`, and `.toolbarItem(...)`.
- `Scene` and the presentation modifiers (`.alert`, `.confirmationDialog`,
  `.sheet`, `.fullScreenCover`, `.popover`, `.popoverTip`, `.toast`) conform
  to `ActionScope`. Boolean and optional-item presentation state is owned by
  the presenter. `onDismiss` observes committed teardown after the entry has
  left the rendered tree.

## Products

The consumer-facing product matrix is the published DocC pair
[Choosing-Modules-And-Platforms.md](../Sources/SwiftTUI/SwiftTUI.docc/Choosing-Modules-And-Platforms.md)
and
[Hosts-And-Platforms.md](../Sources/SwiftTUIRuntime/SwiftTUIRuntime.docc/Hosts-And-Platforms.md);
do not restate the matrix here. The per-product policy boundaries:

### `SwiftTUI`

`SwiftTUI` stays the batteries-included convenience product: it re-exports the
combined terminal/WebHost CLI surface and `SwiftTUIAnimatedImage`, and an
ordinary app writes only `import SwiftTUI`. `SwiftTUIRuntime` stays the
platform-neutral runtime import for host products and custom launchers.
`SwiftTUICore` is target-level pipeline infrastructure, re-exported through
`SwiftTUIRuntime` rather than published as its own product. Public host code
uses `RenderSnapshot`, `RasterSurface`, `SemanticSnapshot`, and
`SemanticHostFrame`. Resolved/measured/placed/draw/commit phase IR stays
package-only.

### `SwiftTUIProfiling`

`SwiftTUIProfiling` is the optional, opt-in profiling product. Nothing in the
default graph depends on it, and it is zero-cost until activated. Its canonical
public surface is the activation entry point and the reusable CPU sampler:

- `ProfilingScene` and the `Scene.profiling(_:)` modifier — env-gated activation
  via `SWIFTTUI_PROFILE`, or an explicit `ProfileConfig`.
- `ProfileConfig` (with `Signal` and `SinkDescriptor`) — the programmatic
  selection of signals and sinks.
- `ProfileActivation` — owns the live session. Call `finish()` at shutdown to
  flush buffered sinks.
- The CPU sampler family — `CPUSampler`, `CPUSample`, `CPUSampleCollector`,
  `ProcessCPUReading`, `CPUSamplerError`.

The record/derivation/TSV types it consumes stay in `SwiftTUIRuntime` (they are
also used by `SwiftTUIWASISurfaceBridge` and the runners), so the runtime never depends
on the product. The sink and record-envelope types are package-internal for now.
The environment grammar builds them.

### Platform integration products

The canonical packaging and engine-profile boundaries live in the DocC article
[Hosts-And-Platforms.md](../Sources/SwiftTUIRuntime/SwiftTUIRuntime.docc/Hosts-And-Platforms.md).
The policy at this package boundary: runners (`SwiftTUICLI`, `SwiftTUIWASI`,
`SwiftTUIWebHost`, `SwiftTUIWebHostCLI`) and the in-package
`SwiftTUIAndroidHost` host ship from this package; the `SwiftUIHost` host is
wholly external in
[`swift-tui-swiftui`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-swiftui); embedding
plumbing remains in `SwiftTUIPTYPrimitives`; terminal views ship from
[`swift-tui-terminal-view`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-terminal-view). Showcase and
example targets never become products.

## Removed From The Public Surface

The `SwiftTUITerminalWorkspace` product (the tabbed/split-pane workspace layer
above `TerminalView`) moved out of the framework and now lives in the
[`terminal-workspace` example](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-examples/tree/main/terminal-workspace)
in `swift-tui-examples`. `SwiftTUITerminalView` from the separate `swift-tui-terminal-view` package
is the public terminal-embedding surface.

These migration-era APIs are no longer public:

- `ViewNode`, `AnyViewNode`, `Leaf`, and `AnyView.init(erasing:)`.
- `Package` and its factory helpers, `NoOpRoot`, `Renderer<Root>`, and
  `StateViewBuilder`.
- Concrete wrapper-view types such as `IDView`, `PaddingView`, `FrameView`,
  `OverlayView`, `BackgroundView`, and `TagValueView`.
- Runtime registry and replay types — `LocalActionRegistry`,
  `LocalKeyHandlerRegistry`, `LocalLifecycleRegistry`, `LocalTaskRegistry`,
  `TaskRegistration`, `LifecycleHandlerSnapshot`, and `LocalKeyEvent`.
- The global hotkey seam — `HotkeyRegistry`, `HotkeyBinding`, and the
  keyboard-help compatibility APIs. Global, always-on key bindings are now bound
  through the ActionScope commands surface. This removal does **not** include the
  focused-key `View.onKeyPress(_:perform:)` modifier, which is a separate,
  canonical API and remains part of the public surface.
- The old public styling shims — `EnvironmentValues.theme` and the string-based
  `foregroundStyle`/`backgroundStyle`/`borderStyle` helpers.
- Render-pipeline implementation IR — `Resolver`, `ResolvedNode`,
  `MeasuredNode`, `PlacedNode`, `DrawNode`, `FrameArtifacts`, `CommitPlan`,
  `CommitPlanner`, `LayoutEngine`, `SemanticExtractor`, `DrawExtractor`,
  `Rasterizer`, `SnapshotRenderer`, and `FrameDropEligibility`. The public
  one-shot renderer result is `RenderSnapshot`. Public diagnostics use
  `FrameDropBlocker` for completed-frame drop blocker vocabulary.

## Package-Only Transitional Seams

These symbols still exist for internal reuse and narrow compatibility. They are
not part of the public API story and must not shape app authoring:

- `PrimitiveView` and `ResolvableView` — internal lowering protocols.
- `ViewNode` — internal runtime plumbing.
- Render phase products and engines — package-only implementation detail behind
  `DefaultRenderer` and `RunLoop`.
- The local runtime registries and lifecycle replay helpers used by `RunLoop`.
- `PrimitiveViewModifier` and `ModifierContentInputs` — primitive
  modifier-lowering hooks.

## Adding public API: checklist

Before making a symbol public, ask:

1. Can the feature be expressed on the canonical SwiftUI-shaped surface
   instead?
2. Does it help new app code, or only package-local migration and tests?
3. Will the README and architecture docs still read as one coherent story?
4. Can it live behind an internal or test-support seam?
5. Is it a real product surface or showcase code that must stay target-only?
   Do not export example apps or showcase targets as package products.
   Experimental or showcase targets follow the same rule: they can remain for
   demos and tests without becoming products.

If the answer points toward internal compatibility rather than product
direction, keep the symbol non-public. When a new public symbol does
land, classify it here before it becomes a default example elsewhere.
