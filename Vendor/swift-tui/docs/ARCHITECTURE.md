# Architecture

This internal document describes the SwiftTUI modules, products, dependency
graph, source layout, and layout model. For the rendering internals, see
[`Runtime-Render-Pipeline.md`](../Sources/SwiftTUIRuntime/SwiftTUIRuntime.docc/Runtime-Render-Pipeline.md). For internal execution-environment notes, see
[HOSTS-AND-PLATFORMS.md](HOSTS-AND-PLATFORMS.md).

## The big picture

    author["Authored views<br/><code>struct App: View</code>"]
    views["SwiftTUIViews<br/>authoring surface"]
    core["SwiftTUICore<br/>pipeline + data model"]
    runtime["SwiftTUIRuntime<br/>run loop + hosting"]
    host["Host presentation"]

    author --> views
    views --> core
    runtime --> core
    runtime --> views
    runtime --> host
```

An author writes `View` values. `SwiftTUIViews` defines that authoring surface.
`SwiftTUICore` is the engine: geometry, the frame pipeline, and the data model
each pipeline phase produces. `SwiftTUIRuntime` owns the run loop, drives the
pipeline, and connects it to a host. A host turns a finished frame into pixels
or terminal bytes.

## Modules and the dependency graph

Collection-binding `ForEach` lookup lives in
`SwiftTUIViews/Collections/ForEachBinding.swift`. Rows share an ID-to-indices
map certified by a stored-value token from `Binding`. `State` exposes the
token of its exact graph slot, retained owner value, or seed.
`SwiftTUIGraph/Resolve/StateSlot.swift` owns `StateValueIdentity`: a fresh token
on every store, copied with checkpoint values so restored and discarded
branches cannot alias. Tokens certify value replacement only. Lookup reuse
requires a standard value-semantic array and an inline stored POD or String ID;
other ID storage, arbitrary sources and externally dependent projections scan
current data. Reads still
go through the source binding so state dependencies remain reader-attributed.

Lazy-stack composition lives in
`SwiftTUIViews/Collections/CompositionalIndexedChildSource.swift`. Eager and
indexed consumers share the builder structural traversal; each ForEach retains
its own identity/occurrence scope and current producer. The graph's grouped
`IndexedChildSourceSnapshot` keeps logical elements separate from rendered
fragments during worker conversion. Core windowed measurement schedules fragment
runs on its work stack and records exact fragment allocations separately from
dense logical-element estimates. The scroll placement applies anchor corrections;
`LocalScrollPositionRegistry` synchronizes bindings only for committed geometry.

`SwiftTUI/swift-tui` is one SwiftPM package. Browser TypeScript source,
examples, and the public website can live in sibling organization repositories.
The public Swift products below live in this package. The engine
is a layered stack of targets
(`SwiftTUIPrimitives` → `SwiftTUIGraph` → `SwiftTUICore` → `SwiftTUIViews` →
`SwiftTUIRuntime`). `SwiftTUIViews` and `SwiftTUIRuntime` are also published
library products; convenience and host products build on those layers. The
generated [product and module map](PUBLIC_MODULE_MAP.md) records product roots,
supported direct imports, declaration ownership, and conditional re-export paths.

### Core targets

The engine uses five targets with compiler-enforced boundaries. These
boundaries separate the reconciliation engine from the render machinery in an
AttributeGraph-shaped design. `SwiftTUIViews` and `SwiftTUIRuntime` are published
products and supported direct imports. `SwiftTUIPrimitives`, `SwiftTUIGraph`,
and `SwiftTUICore` are non-product targets. Consumers reach their public
vocabulary through re-exports (`@_exported`) from the supported product imports;
the owning module remains unchanged.

- **`SwiftTUIPrimitives`** — the leaf vocabulary. It contains inert
  `Equatable`/`Sendable` value types with no engine or render-pipeline
  algorithms. These include geometry
  (cells/points/rects, `Identity`/`StructuralPath`/`EntityIdentity`), style and
  color-science values, and draw/layout metadata (`DrawPayload` and its payload
  cluster, `LayoutBehavior`, `LayoutMetadata`). They also include pointer and
  semantic values and the `Animatable` math stack. It does not use
  Foundation. It depends only on the standard library, plus
  `SwiftTUIVendorFigletEmbeddedFonts` for the figlet payload value. It builds on
  its own.
- **`SwiftTUIGraph`** — the reconciliation engine (the AttributeGraph analog).
  It owns the retained `ViewGraph`/`ViewNode`/`ResolvedNode` graph, state slots,
  dependency tracking, invalidation planning, dirty-evaluation planning, reuse
  gates, checkpoints, entity routing, and lifecycle planning. It also owns the
  identity-keyed runtime registries, frame scheduler, and animation *intent*
  types. It performs
  no layout/draw/raster/commit work. It stores render values opaquely and hands
  erased evaluator thunks up to the Views driver. Depends on `SwiftTUIPrimitives`
  **only**. A successful `swift build --target SwiftTUIGraph` proves that graph
  code does not name a render type. It does not use Foundation.
  `Resolve/ComparisonWork.swift` owns optional retained-comparison tallies;
  the comparison walkers select a counting or non-counting specialization.
  `Pipeline/FramePacing.swift` defines the optional merge-pressure readiness
  policy. The scheduler counts fresh coalesced invalidations, excluding cancelled
  intent replay, and folds committed consume-to-acknowledgment cost under its
  existing lock. `SWIFTTUI_MERGE_PRESSURE_PACING=1` delays only pure invalidation
  wakes by half the EWMA, capped at 50 ms, during the second after observed
  pressure. Other causes and eligible due deadlines bypass it. Readiness and
  wake-time queries share the gate; it creates no deadline intent. The gate
  defaults off. Profiling still collects the cost when disabled; unprofiled,
  disabled runs pay no extra frame-clock read. Samples retain the consume-time
  snapshot in `scheduledFrame`, and TSV exports `merged_invalidations`,
  `pace_ewma`/`pace_gap` (milliseconds), and `pace_engaged` (whether the frame
  was held by the gate). Async cost includes suspension, so it is a latency
  signal rather than a direct measure of main-actor CPU occupancy.
- **`SwiftTUICore`** — the render engine. Consumes the graph's immutable
  `ResolvedNode` snapshots. It runs measure, place, the semantic and draw
  extractors, the rasterizer, and the commit planner. It also runs the text/image
  content engine, style *resolution*, focus tracking, and frame-drop/elision
  policy. The one sanctioned back-edge from render to graph is the
  layout-dependent-content realization callback (the GeometryReader analog).
  Depends on `SwiftTUIGraph` + `SwiftTUIPrimitives` and `@_exported`-imports both
  so its public vocabulary reaches supported product imports. Direct external
  `import SwiftTUICore` is not a supported product contract. Foundation-free.
  `Measure/RetainedValidationWork.swift` combines Graph's comparison tallies
  with Core's measured-product checks and identity/metadata restamping work.
  `LayoutPassContext` owns the optional accumulator; runtime diagnostics and
  profiling consume its snapshot without a dependency from Graph to Core.
- **`SwiftTUIViews`** — the authoring surface. The `View` protocol, view
  builders, containers, controls, layout, state, focus, gestures, modifiers,
  and shapes. `View` is body-only and `@MainActor`-isolated, and its
  conformers — like those of `ViewModifier`, the style protocols, and
  `DynamicProperty` — are value types: each protocol carries a defaulted
  witness whose `Self: AnyObject` overload is unavailable, so a class
  conformance fails to compile (plan 2026-08-29-001). Lowering to
  primitives is package-internal. `@State` ownership is bound at capture
  time: a pass at the body-evaluation seams (`resolveViewElements`' two
  branches, plus the composed-modifier and style-body forwarding seams)
  writes each evaluation's state owner into the exact container copy the
  body consumes, so closures created in bodies carry their owner. Imperative
  access resolves resolve-ambient → carried capture (with a fire-time
  identity refresh for re-minted nodes) → loud authored seed; there is no
  ambient owner-guessing ladder (plan 2026-08-20-001).
- **`SwiftTUIRuntime`** — the run loop, the renderer, scenes (`App`, `Scene`,
  `WindowGroup`), terminal hosting, and the host-frame contracts.

The graph and render layers also carry sampled reconciliation soundness probes.
Their canonical invariant, enforcement, sampling, and test-owner inventory is
the [soundness oracle map](SOUNDNESS-ORACLES.md). The repository policy phase
makes sure that every source recorder, trace kind, and counter remains
represented.

### Published library products

- **`SwiftTUI`** — the batteries-included convenience product. It re-exports
  the combined terminal/WebHost CLI surface and `SwiftTUIAnimatedImage`. An
  ordinary app writes only `import SwiftTUI`. It gets standard flags, default
  terminal `App.main()`, `--web` localhost launch, and animated GIF/image
  support.
- **`SwiftTUIRuntime`**, **`SwiftTUIViews`** — usable directly by hosts and
  custom launchers that do not want the convenience product.
- **`SwiftTUICharts`** (external) — `LineChart`, `CalendarHeatmap`,
  `Sparkline`, and related dashboard views now ship from the peer repository
  [`SwiftTUI/swift-tui-charts`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-charts),
  composed on the public `SwiftTUIViews` surface.
- **`SwiftTUIAnimatedImage`** — finite, pre-composed animated-image playback and
  GIF import/export. It is available as a standalone product for narrow
  compositions and is included by the `SwiftTUI` convenience product.
- **`SwiftTUIProfiling`** — optional, opt-in profiling and diagnostics. It adds a
  `.profiling()` scene modifier (env-gated via `SWIFTTUI_PROFILE`). This modifier
  carries three independently selectable signals: per-frame timing, memory
  occupancy, and CPU/RSS. It routes them to TSV, JSONL, or summary sinks. Nothing
  in the default graph
  depends on it. Activation is zero-cost until requested. It builds on the
  runtime's neutral emit contract (`FrameDiagnosticSink` / `RuntimeFrameSample`)
  and the `SwiftTUICore` occupancy registry, so the runtime never depends on the
  product. The `SwiftTUI` convenience import does not include it.

### Platform, host, and embedding products

Except for the explicitly external SwiftUI host, these live in the **root
package** (`Package.swift`). The `Platforms/` directory holds their sources but
contains no nested Swift packages.

- **In-package integrations** — `SwiftTUITerminalCLI` (`TerminalRunner`, the
  portable launch half) with `SwiftTUICLIAttach` (the POSIX-only attach
  subsystem: PTYs, Unix sockets, instance discovery) behind a
  platform-conditional edge, re-exported together by the `SwiftTUICLI`
  compatibility facade over the `SwiftTUIPlatformIO` syscall facade and
  framework-owned `TerminalSignal` value. The vendored signal implementation
  depends on this leaf value; its `UnixSignal` spelling is a compatibility
  alias, so existing typed signal arrays still work with `SignalReader`;
  `SwiftTUIWASI` (`WASIRunner`), `SwiftTUIWebHost` (`WebHostRunner`),
  `SwiftTUIWebHostCLI` (`WebHostCLIRunner`), `SwiftTUIAndroidHost`, and
  `SwiftTUIArguments` (argument parsing and `RuntimeConfiguration` flags).
  `SwiftTUITerminalCLI`, `SwiftTUICLIAttach`, and `SwiftTUIPlatformIO` are
  non-product support targets. External packages select `SwiftTUICLI` or another
  published host product and use the surface it exposes; those support target
  names are not supported direct imports.
- **External host** — the `SwiftUIHost` product for embedding SwiftTUI inside
  SwiftUI on macOS/iOS lives in the separate
  [`swift-tui-swiftui`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-swiftui)
  package, not under this package's `Platforms/` tree.
- **Terminal-program embedding** — `TerminalView`, session management, and
  the SwiftTerm-backed emulator ship from the separate
  [`swift-tui-terminal-view`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-terminal-view)
  package as `SwiftTUITerminalView`. This framework retains
  `SwiftTUIPTYPrimitives` (PTY creation, child spawning, fd lifecycle, resize)
  and its conditional C shim dependency for POSIX CLI attach. The tabbed and
  split-pane workspace lives in the `terminal-workspace` example in
  `SwiftTUI/swift-tui-examples`.

`SwiftTUIWebHost` owns the embedded in-tree HTTP/WebSocket server
(`WebHostLoopbackServer` + `WebHostWebSocketWire`, no external networking
dependency) and the bundled browser resources. `SwiftTUIWebHostCLI` composes that host with the
terminal runner, and the `SwiftTUI` convenience product includes it by default.
Use `SwiftTUICLI` directly for a terminal-only graph.

`WebHostOutboundBudget` bounds the transport pump, acknowledged scene output,
and socket outbox. Socket completion propagates back to the pump, so a slow
reader cannot move its backlog into a downstream unbounded stream. See the
[outbound delivery policy](HOST-WIRE-CONTRACT.md#webhost-outbound-delivery-budget).

## Source layout

The passive composition families live beside their primitives in
`SwiftTUIViews/Primitives/`: `LabeledContainers.swift` captures authored slots,
and `LabelStyles.swift`, `LabeledContentStyles.swift`, and `GroupBoxStyles.swift`
own their public configurations, erasers, and built-in bodies. They resolve
through the shared `Foundation/StyleBoxing.swift` seam. Environment keys and
modifiers remain in `Environment/StyleEnvironment.swift` and
`Modifiers/StyleModifiers.swift`.
All 28 erasers use `ConcreteStyleBox` for storage and reuse comparison.
`Controls/PickerOption.swift` supplies the explicit text-and-tag metadata
declaration. `Collections/CollectionStyleValidation.swift` validates List,
Table, and Outline presentations before they reach layout and draw.
Body-producing families share its body resolver; styles with dynamic properties
use a prepared concrete working copy under the body's rebased authoring scope.

Framework environment keys explicitly conform to `FrameworkEnvironmentKey`.
Only keys qualified for tracked resolve-time consumption adopt
`ReaderAttributedFrameworkEnvironmentKey`; the classification cache tests these
markers instead of reflected module/type names. External keys retain public
reader attribution. The production-key ownership test guards marker coverage;
memo shadow and dedicated boundary tests remain the certification evidence.

`Controls/ToggleStyles.swift`, `DisclosureGroupStyles.swift`, and
`ProgressViewStyles.swift` own their style families. The shared
`ControlStyleRow.swift` provides pure row composition across the bound-control,
value-control, and menu families. Toggle and disclosure primitives retain activation,
enablement guards, and semantic roles. `Input/TextEditorStyles.swift` surrounds
the editor's protected content; `TextEditor.swift` owns the binding, selection,
scroll position, and viewport-width probe used for wrapped caret navigation.
Circular indeterminate progress composes the environment-styled `Spinner`.

`Controls/SliderStyles.swift` and `StepperStyles.swift` own the value-control
style contracts and built-ins. Numeric normalization, formatting, and typed updates remain in
`ControlValueMath.swift`, the slider/stepper primitives, and
`AdjustableControlValueSupport.swift`. The shared `Foundation/StyleRoute.swift`
wrapper forwards optional pointer capture to `Controls/PointerRouteView.swift`.

`Presentation/PaletteStyles.swift` defines data-only command configurations and
typed style erasure. `PaletteStyleHost.swift` owns activation routes beneath the
presented source lifetime; `DefaultPaletteRendering.swift` supplies the public
default's fuzzy filtering, identity-based selection, and twelve-row window.
The dropdown portal continues to own placement, focus, Escape, and dismissal.

`ScrollView/ScrollViewStyles.swift` supplies indicator and container appearance.
`ScrollViewLayout.swift` measures insets and optional reserved tracks; the inert
`ScrollIndicatorAppearance` metadata carries those choices into core placement,
semantics, and draw extraction. These phases share the content viewport, while
the scroll primitive retains offset bindings, indicator dragging, and host-gated
panning. Reserved tracks are outside the content clip; overlay indicators paint
after content. `Controls/LinkStyles.swift` supplies rich-text appearance to
`Link.swift`, which merges inherited text, style presentation, and label styling
before stamping link identity and destination. Existing link action and focus
routing consume that same payload.
Custom placement records the chosen viewport on its content child. Core
publication, drawing, and indicator hit testing consume that exact rectangle
instead of independently solving the indicator insets again. Overlay tracks
reserve their shared corner for the vertical indicator without shrinking the
scrollable content viewport.

`Controls/MenuStyles.swift` owns menu composition and its public trigger and
portal wrappers. `Menu.swift` owns activation and expansion on a dedicated child
node, so replacing a compact menu with inline content retires its expansion.
Captured menu content has a declaration-owned entity host, preserving state
and running tasks across inline/floating style changes.
`Presentation/AnchoredSurfaceStylePresentation.swift` supplies insets, bounds,
and paints to the shared presentation host. A finite viewport uses one scroll
content host and keeps short content intrinsic.

`Primitives/ControlGroupStyles.swift` composes horizontal, vertical, and compact
menu hosts. `Foundation/CapturedSubviewSequenceView.swift` expands authored
children separately while `CapturedSubviewRetention.swift` keeps their logical
identity under the declaring group. Graph's `Resolve/RetainedSubviewState.swift`
retains persistent slots, including authored reference values, for omitted
content. Runtime captures those slots before departure and publishes them only
with an accepted commit. Runtime registrations and presentation hosts depart
normally. Lazy tabs also retain authored model references, under the distinct
owned-state provenance. Retained archives project into detached
`DormantStateSlotSnapshot` records at that boundary; framework persistent
slots retain the recursive value audit.

`TabViews/TabSelectionState.swift` owns tab selection, tag-qualified strip focus,
option churn and overflow slot operations. `TabDormancy.swift` owns archive
transitions, payload generations, locator intake and commit refreshes. Both
operate on the declaring graph node's slots, so checkpoints restore their state.
The archive registry and transient live-graph locator remain separate slots;
`TabView.swift` composes the active content and registers input handlers through
these collaborators.

`SwiftTUIGraph/HotReload/` owns package-internal cross-generation state currency.
`SnapshotCoding` encodes Codable slots into detached scalar/container values
without Foundation. Limits bound nesting (128), values (65,536), and cumulative
key/string UTF-8 bytes (4 MiB) per encoded slot. Integer encodings preserve
64-bit and 128-bit boundaries; floating snapshots compare bit patterns.
Codable model references decode as new instances. Non-Codable values and
transient runtime slots carry explicit capture diagnostics. Framework dormant
containers project detached archives for immediate encoding; replay retains no
registry objects. Nested archive traversal is limited to 64 levels.

`HotReloadReplay` matches complete destination owner schemas before slot
initialization. Exact owners reserve their source records; one-component
wrapper fallbacks require uniqueness in both directions and never remove
entity or indexed-sibling components. Declaration-rank fallback requires
equal counts and type agreement within each discovered-property path.
Count/type changes conservatively reset that entire path group. Structural
matching cannot infer semantic changes to same-typed declarations.
Co-resident source owners and duplicate destination schemas are refused.

Replay installs only under a fresh disjoint root on one graph. New slot
initialization decodes through the destination type, consumes the record,
and otherwise uses the new authored seed. The replay table and diagnostics
live in `FrameCommitState`, so graph rollback restores consumption.
`finishHotReloadReplay` reports unused records. Inactive records can remain until
their owner materializes, when a read-only declaration walk requires the entire
exact slot/type set before any claim. Inactive content never uses ordinal-rank
or wrapper guesses. Subsequent snapshots carry still-inactive encoded records.

`SwiftTUIRuntime/HotReload/` owns package-internal static generation swaps. A
private scoped root factory resolves below a disjoint generation prefix and a
stable erased payload component. It rehearses the replacement in fresh graphs
without lifecycle publication, up to four schema passes, before installation.
State-dependent topology must converge; refusal preserves the live generation.
The commit retires old handlers/tasks and invokes old disappear handlers before
new appear/task work. Focus follows the accepted owner map; Codable scroll and
focus storage reconstructs runtime registrations. Pointer scratch resets.
Identical-content, wrapper, inactive-tab, focus/scroll, real async input/task and
100-generation tests cover the host.

On DEBUG macOS/Linux terminal sessions, `swifttui-dev` sets a private spool
environment variable to arm the native loader. SIGUSR1 queues a load at the next
frame boundary. A 0700 same-user directory, bounded regular files, monotonic
manifest names and scalar ABI/toolchain exports are checked before the retained
root payload is cast. Application images resolve framework symbols from the
executable; macOS uses first-image lookup and Linux binds image-local symbols.
Images are never unloaded, including compatibility refusals after `dlopen`.
The loader stops at 100 images and unlinks consumed spool files.

`Tools/SwiftTUIDev` owns the public `swifttui-dev` executable. It builds a debug
host with exported framework symbols, watches Swift executable-target sources,
then uses SwiftPM's compiler description to rebuild that target into each
replacement image. Every image has a unique Swift ABI module namespace, avoiding
duplicate Objective-C class registration. Graph-scoped declared aliases compare
Codable type schemas and the concrete-type component of nested `AnyView` owners.
The graph retains aliases after replay so subsequent frames keep the same logical
payload identity. User values and authored identity components remain exact. Compilation
is serialized; edits remain observable during builds and invalidate stale
candidates. Dependency content, manifests, lockfiles, resources and toolchain
and source-file-set changes require a restart. The app acknowledges a committed frame, which gives
the driver's optional JSON event log its timing endpoint. Native release and
WASI builds contain no loader, signal hook or public `HotReloadExport` API.

Viewport lifecycle carry follows a uniquely matched visible identity when its
backing node changes. `ViewGraphLifecyclePlanning.swift` emits task transfers
for unchanged descriptors and keeps replacements keyed to their old cancel and
new start owners. `LifecycleCoordinator` applies these transfers at commit;
`TaskRunner` moves the existing handle and its completion owner together.
Its owner-to-keys and logical-identity/descriptor indexes share one removal
operation with cancellation and generation-checked completion. Startup never
scans unrelated tasks; owner cancellation visits only that owner's keys.
Collapsed nodes merge adopted task registrations by descriptor, preserving
independent modifiers while keeping the current registration for a matching slot.
Observation checkpoint restore requires no actively recording draft; restoration
retires suspended draft mailboxes, whose owners must discard them before reuse.
`Lifecycle/LifecycleCarryForward.swift` preserves transfer order through deferred
commits, and the `taskTransfer` frame-drop blocker prevents dropping that work.

Portal declarations capture their style environment before evaluating the
presentation trigger. `PromptPresentationEntrypoints.swift` selects one of five
fixed surfaces: prompt actions, standard sheet content, dropdown content,
full-screen content, or anchored content. A prepared typed resolver carries
that selection into the coordinator host. No surface-kind or body-mode switch
crosses the host boundary. Alert and confirmation share PromptStyle; cover and
popover have independent presentation-value families. Boolean and item sheet
declarations both resolve SheetStyle. Coordinators retain focus, modal policy,
stacking, Escape, action scopes, and committed dismissal observers.
Painting and Escape share cross-family activation order, and the topmost modal
suppresses routes in all earlier surfaces. Popover content resolves eagerly;
its custom layout reads the source's current rendered frame during placement,
so nested declarations reach presentation reconciliation before layout.

### Vendored target naming

Sources under `Vendor/` keep their upstream directory names, but the SwiftPM
**targets** they declare are all prefixed `SwiftTUIVendor…`:

| Upstream module | swift-tui target | Sources |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `UnixSignals` | `SwiftTUIVendorUnixSignals` | `Vendor/UnixSignals/` |
| `SwiftFiglet` | `SwiftTUIVendorFiglet` | `Vendor/swift-figlet/` |
| `EmbeddedFonts` | `SwiftTUIVendorFigletEmbeddedFonts` | `Vendor/swift-figlet/` |
| `GIF` | `SwiftTUIVendorGIF` | `Vendor/swift-gif/` |
| `JPEG` | `SwiftTUIVendorJPEG` | `Vendor/swift-jpeg/` |
| `PNG` | `SwiftTUIVendorPNG` | `Vendor/swift-png/` |

SwiftPM requires unique target names across the **entire** package graph. Any
target reachable from one of our products enters every consumer's graph. Under
their upstream names, these modules break consumers. For example, a package that
depends on both swift-tui and swift-service-lifecycle (which ships its own
`UnixSignals`) fails resolution with

```
error: multiple packages ('swift-service-lifecycle', 'swift-tui') declare
targets with a conflicting name: 'UnixSignals'
```

The names `GIF`, `JPEG`, `PNG`, and `SwiftFiglet` can cause the same problem.
Image and text packages are likely to use these names. The prefix removes the
conflict and shows which copy the code imports. For example,
`import SwiftTUIVendorPNG` imports our vendored copy, not upstream swift-png.

The same reasoning covers first-party `SwiftTUIWASISurfaceBridge` (sources at
`Platforms/WASI/Sources/WASISurfaceBridge/`), which is reachable from the
`SwiftTUIWASI` and `SwiftTUIWebHost` products.

Only the `import` line carries the vendored name. `GIF`, `JPEG`, and `PNG` each
declare a `public enum` that matches their old module name. Thus, use sites such
as `PNG.Image` continue to resolve against the enum without changes.

## The frame pipeline, in one paragraph

A frame is built by running an authored view tree through **seven typed
phases** (`resolve → measure → place → semantics → draw → raster → commit`).
Each phase produces a distinct package-owned product (`ResolvedNode`, `MeasuredNode`,
`PlacedNode`, `SemanticSnapshot`, `DrawNode`, `RasterSurface`, `CommitPlan`).
The public one-shot renderer returns a `RenderSnapshot`. It exposes the
committed raster, semantic snapshot, presentation damage, and diagnostics. The
intermediate phase IR remains package-only.
The runtime drives these phases through a small **stage pipeline**
(`head → animationInjection → latePreferenceReconciliation → fusedFrameTail →
commit`) that decides what runs on the main actor versus a frame-tail worker.
The full developer-facing mechanics are in
[`Runtime-Render-Pipeline.md`](../Sources/SwiftTUIRuntime/SwiftTUIRuntime.docc/Runtime-Render-Pipeline.md).

`Lifecycle/NestedMatchedGeometryPlacement.swift` resolves co-present adoption
dependencies in displayed coordinates. The placed overlay walk composes nested
offsets, and frozen removal snapshots retain each descendant's absolute adoption
displacement while the retained layout baseline stays unchanged.

The same main-actor seam after layout enrolls numeric text from realized
collection rows in the animation ledger and reprojects the head's current text
sample onto eager rows. `PlacedNodeResolvedMetadata.textAnimationTransaction`
carries only the relevant text's authored intent through the sparse placed
metadata storage. Retained layout keeps destination text and geometry; the
placed overlay snapshot owns each frame's draw-time roll.

`Animation/ScopedStyleAnimation.swift` records the authoring transaction for
foreground and tint writes in scoped modifier bodies. Placeholder restoration
preserves that per-style provenance while restoring the base transaction;
closer base-view style writers clear or replace the provenance.

`resolve` reuses unchanged work in two ways. **Retained reuse** skips a subtree
that is separate from the frame's invalidation. **Memoized-body reuse** is on by
default. It can also skip a subtree under an invalidated ancestor when all of
these conditions are true:

- Its view value compares equal to the previous frame's value under the type's
  comparison plan, built once per type: an `Equatable` type uses its own `==`,
  a POD type compares by bytes, and other certified layouts compare field by
  field. An unplannable value (closure captures, `AnyView`, opaque
  existentials) recomputes instead. The gate never reflects at compare time.
- Its tracked dependencies (`@State`, `@Observable`, focus state) are covered
  and clean, and no invalidation lies inside the served subtree.
- Its environment matches the committed snapshot for the keys it depends on.

`MemoReadCertificates.swift` defines immutable-scalar state replacement
witnesses and observation registration currency. The gate validates them
throughout the served subtree; fired observation callbacks stay invalid across
checkpoint restoration. Reference-backed and other opaque state values remain
uncovered. The normative reuse article below specifies the supported types and
registration lifecycle.

`EquatableView` and `View.equatable()` remain the explicit opt-in. They make
the author's `==` the whole comparison contract, including captured closures
that the comparison plan would otherwise refuse.
The complete ordering, input contracts, freshness-stamp algebra, suppression
rules, and oracle boundaries are documented in
[Reuse and invalidation](../Sources/SwiftTUIGraph/SwiftTUIGraph.docc/Reuse-and-Invalidation.md).

## The layout model

Layout is SwiftUI-shaped: a recursive size negotiation, not a constraint
solver.

1. A parent proposes a size to each child.
2. Each child reports the size it wants for that proposal.
3. The parent places each child within its own bounds.

Modifier order matters because each modifier is a node in the tree that
re-proposes or re-places. `Layout`, `AnyLayout`, and `ViewThatFits` expose this
to authored code. `LayoutValueKey` carries per-child layout data.

Some content cannot be sized until its container's geometry is known. Examples
include `GeometryReader` and anchor-based preferences. SwiftTUI handles this
with **layout-dependent content realization**. SwiftTUI realizes the affected
subtree after it resolves the enclosing geometry. It does not guess and then
correct the geometry.

Custom layouts are `Sendable` values with `Sendable` caches. `Layout` requires
both, so the renderer can evaluate any custom layout on the frame-tail worker.
Layouts can also publish stable
measurement/placement reuse signatures to opt into cross-frame reuse.

## Host modes and engine profiles

[HOSTS-AND-PLATFORMS.md](HOSTS-AND-PLATFORMS.md) owns the canonical host
matrix, packaging boundaries, and per-host engine profiles. The hosts consume
the same phase products and committed-frame contracts, but their resolve reuse,
selective-evaluation, and stack-depth policies are not identical.

## Concurrency model

The package builds in Swift 6 language mode with `.defaultIsolation(.none)`.
Code states isolation explicitly. It does not rely on inferred isolation.
`View`, `Scene`, and `App` are
`@MainActor` authoring protocols, and the public APIs that evaluate authored
`body` trees (`DefaultRenderer.render` and `DefaultRenderer.renderAsync`) are
`@MainActor`. The package-only `Resolver.resolve` entry point is also
`@MainActor`. The heavy middle of the pipeline runs off the main actor on a
frame-tail worker. The boundaries are described in
[`Runtime-Render-Pipeline.md`](../Sources/SwiftTUIRuntime/SwiftTUIRuntime.docc/Runtime-Render-Pipeline.md). The repo
forbids `@unchecked Sendable` and `nonisolated(unsafe)`. Shared mutable state
uses honest isolation or `Synchronization` primitives.

## Glossary

- **Phase product** — the package-only typed value that a pipeline phase emits
  (`ResolvedNode`, `MeasuredNode`, `PlacedNode`, `SemanticSnapshot`, `DrawNode`,
  `RasterSurface`, `CommitPlan`). All seven are gathered on package-only
  `FrameArtifacts`. Public snapshot and host code consumes `RenderSnapshot`,
  `RasterSurface`, `SemanticSnapshot`, or `SemanticHostFrame`.
- **Resolve** — turning an authored `View` tree into a `ResolvedNode` graph
  with the resolved identity projection, structural position, entity identity,
  and state owner attached.
- **Frame tail** — the off-main portion of a frame: measure through raster.
- **Frame head** — the on-main portion that resolves the tree and stages
  side effects before the tail runs.
- **Commit** — applying a finished frame's `CommitPlan` to a host surface.
- **Cell space** — the integer terminal grid (`CellPoint`, `CellSize`,
  `CellRect`).
- **Continuous cell space** — fractional coordinates over that grid (`Point`,
  `Size`, `Rect`, `Vector`), used for gestures, hover, drawing, and animation.
- **Pixel space** — device pixels (`PixelPoint`, `PixelSize`), used only for
  host/graphics interop.
- **Semantic snapshot** — the per-frame `SemanticSnapshot`, including the flat
  `accessibilityNodes` array, consumed by accessibility and focus.
- **Host** — the component that presents a committed frame. The canonical host
  matrix is in [HOSTS-AND-PLATFORMS.md](HOSTS-AND-PLATFORMS.md).
- **Action scope** — a node in the focus chain that can own key commands,
  palette commands, and toolbar items (`ActionScope`).
- **Publication** — the act of committing graph-recorded runtime registrations
  to the live dispatch registries after resolve.
- **Fingerprint** — a registration projection that supports equality. SwiftTUI
  uses it to compute publication changes or compare a scoped restore with a
  scratch rebuild.
- **Frontier** — the highest stitchable evaluator targets that cover all queued
  graph-local dirty work.
- **Cone** — the self, ancestor, and descendant region whose resolved output can
  change because of an invalidation or structural churn.
- **Rail** — one of the parallel work ledgers for invalidated nodes and
  graph-local dirty work. SwiftTUI reconciles these ledgers before frontier
  planning.
- **Strand** — stored, listed, or published graph state that is no longer
  reachable through its ownership path, or that the path no longer retires.
- **Island** — resolved content connected to its host through `evaluationHost`
  instead of an ordinary live `parent` edge.
- **Servable** — a committed subtree with enough gate-specific evidence to
  return without evaluating its body.
- **Freshness stamp** — one of the fresh, island-stale, and foreign-parented
  `CommittedFreshness` verdicts that control snapshot service and rebuild.
- **Reuse door** — the single `ViewGraph.reuseResolvedSubtree` seam. It owns the
  retained-before-memo order and the common acceptance effects.
- **Suppression scope** — a finite set of focus or press identities. It names
  forced recomputation that ordinary invalidation does not fully represent.
- **Oracle** — an independently evaluated invariant that exposes false reuse,
  lost work, incoherent stamps, or stranded ownership.

## Design history: reuse and invalidation

Dated coordination records that explain why the current reuse and invalidation
contracts exist. They live in the `SwiftTUI/swift-tui-org` coordination root's
`docs/reports/` tree (collaborator-only), so the paths below are intentionally
not links. This history moved here from the published
`SwiftTUIGraph` DocC article, which describes `HEAD` only.

- `docs/reports/2026-06-13-swifttui-invalidation-gap-analysis.md` and
  `docs/reports/2026-06-14-stage-0-frontier-publication-inventory.md`
  established the value-change, dirty-frontier, and registration-publication
  model.
- `docs/reports/2026-06-15-reuse-trace-productization-and-cone-confirmation.md`
  measured ancestor invalidation blanketing a descendant background and made
  the cone vocabulary operational.
- `docs/reports/2026-06-17-memo-stage0-killgate.md` demonstrated the shadow
  oracle's ability to find errors.
  `docs/reports/2026-06-17-memo-stage2-flag-gated-gate.md` established why
  production comparison first shipped as an `Equatable`-only opt-in. Per-type
  comparison plans later widened that gate; per-compare reflection stayed
  diagnostic-only.
- `docs/reports/2026-07-17-001-gallery-fuzzer-diagnostics-campaign.md`, §9.10
  “Style-seam re-land + retained-placement identity fix (2026-07-18, session
  5),” explains the authoring-owner override and island-bridging invalidation.
  Section §9.11, “Final two fixes: paired-route leak and visited-spare strand
  (2026-07-18, session 5),” records fixed-point spare adjudication. Public
  [commit `8560d337`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui/commit/8560d3371b031268a7e92d95c744feef494e71ec)
  is the corresponding combined child-repository evidence.
- `docs/reports/2026-07-23-002-reuse-freshness-quirk-register.md`, “Residual 2
  — closure (2026-07-25),” records the live-object stranded-listing invariant,
  its deliberate teeth, and the resolved-vs-authored identity naming pitfall.

## Reusable image ownership and ordered presentation

`ImageContentRepository` admits immutable encoded bytes under a lifetime-unique
owner ID. Its shared default retains at most 256 entries and 128 MiB, including
encoded bytes, byte-key storage and estimated metadata. File revisions include
POSIX device/inode, size and nanosecond modification/change times, verified on
both sides of a read. Windows/WASI use read-then-byte-exact lookup where a reliable
revision fast path is unavailable. This is validation when a source is requested,
not a filesystem watcher. Embedded keys sample at most 128 bytes for hashing and
compare full contents on collision. Eviction retires the owner; reacquisition has
a new owner ID and the same deterministic wire fingerprints for identical bytes.

The owner computes wire, blend and Kitty digests in one admission pass. Asset
resolution, decoded images, blend variants and terminal payloads key reuse by
that owner instead of a mutable file path or a fresh full-buffer hash. The memory
metric `ImageContentRepository.sources` reports retained bytes, reads and hashed
bytes. File replacement changes content and geometry on the next resolution;
placements and repeated animation frames can reuse admitted content.

`ImageBlendCompositor.orderedAttachments` consumes the raster sidecar's image
order and intervening plain-cell occluders. An overlapping blended image samples
prior decoded/precomposed images into its captured cell backdrop using the
portable linear-sRGB arithmetic. Its variant key includes prior content owners,
geometry, opacity and occlusion, without retaining the prior decoded buffers in
the key. Existing blend-cache budgets include this metadata. Non-overlapping
images retain their original path. The upper image's own placement opacity stays
outside its encoded variant on capable native/wire hosts, so opacity-only updates
can reuse it. Terminal preparation bakes that opacity over the ordered destination
and emits an opaque placement, matching the existing terminal blend path.

Terminal preparation, hosted raster delivery, and both full/delta web wire
encoding use this preparation. Android consumes that same wire encoder. The
ordinary PNG attachment protocol remains sufficient; native CoreGraphics/canvas
blend-mode replay and a new wire version are unnecessary. Hosts still paint
final cells followed by image attachments; this is ordered image precomposition,
not a general replay of every interleaved cell paint event. Terminal graphics
preserve attachment order instead of sorting overlapping placements by identity.
