# Changelog

All notable changes to SwiftTUI are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

SwiftTUI is pre-1.0: while the public surface is being proven, minor releases
may make source-breaking API adjustments. Pin with `.upToNextMinor`.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.14.0] - 2026-09-20

Borders, strokes and dividers now draw through one renderer. This release breaks
no source. It changes one default look, and it deprecates the APIs that the
next minor release removes.

### Added

- `StrokeStyle` carries SwiftUI's `dash`, `dashPhase` and `lineJoin`. Dash
  lengths are cell widths measured round the outline, a dash end inside a cell
  draws a half-line glyph (`╴╶╵╷`), and an unpainted segment leaves its cells as
  they were. `dashPhase` is animatable, so `withAnimation` moves the pattern
  round all four edges: a marching-ants border. `lineJoin: .round` draws the arc
  corners where the glyph palette has them.
- `View.border(_:style:placement:sides:)` takes a `StrokeStyle`. A border, a
  rectangle stroke and a `Divider` now draw through one renderer, so the same
  style draws the same cells on all three.
- `Shape.trim(from:to:)` keeps part of a shape's outline, and
  `Path.trimmedPath(from:to:)` does the same for a path. Start points and
  direction match SwiftUI as measured. The interval is animatable on a stroke.
- Curved shapes and custom paths honor `dash` and `dashPhase`, in Braille dots
  and in the same unit as a rectangle's dash. They ignored the stroke style.
- `AngularGradient`, with SwiftUI's initializers and the `.angularGradient` and
  `.conicGradient` shorthands. Angles follow SwiftUI as measured: zero at three
  o'clock, increasing clockwise, geometric on screen. It paints fills, strokes
  and borders, and its angles animate.
- A border painted with one animatable style animates that paint under
  `withAnimation`, as a shape stroke's paint does. A border's paint used to snap.
- Line strokes that share a cell join. A `Divider` that runs into a border ends
  in `├`, two lines that cross draw `┼`, and borders on single sides meet in a
  corner. Borders, rectangle strokes and dividers all join, in any order, and
  the junction takes the color of the stroke drawn last. `Text`, the half-block
  palettes and Braille strokes do not join. The `.ascii` palette joins in its
  own glyphs: `-` and `|` make `+`. The last stroke to reach a cell used to
  replace the one under it.
- `StrokeStyle` has a preset for every glyph palette: `.singleDouble`,
  `.doubleSingle`, `.outerHalfBlock`, `.none`, `.dashed` and `.dashedHeavy` join
  the existing ones.

### Changed

- **The default border and the default stroke have square corners (`┌`), as in
  SwiftUI.** They were rounded (`╭`). `StrokeStyle()` is now `.single`, and
  `border()`, `stroke()` and `strokeBorder()` follow it. The built-in controls
  ask for rounded corners themselves and look as they did. Pass
  `style: .rounded` to keep rounded corners on your own borders.
- A `RoundedRectangle` stroke draws rounded corners whatever the palette's own
  corners are. It drew square corners under `.single`.
- `BorderSet.dashed` and `.dashedHeavy` dash round the perimeter, one cell
  width on and one off, without the `·` gap glyph. They restarted their pattern
  on every edge. Through `Shape.stroke` they drew a solid ring, which is fixed.
- A rectangle stroke one row high draws a line. It drew `┌──┐`.
- `DrawCommand.border` carries the `StrokeStyle` in place of the `BorderSet`.

### Deprecated

The next minor release removes everything in this section. Each entry names its
replacement, and the replacement is available now.

- `View.border(blend:set:placement:sides:phase:)` and `BorderBlend`. Paint the
  border with an `AngularGradient`, such as
  `.conicGradient(colors:angle:)`, and animate its angle. A blend starts at the
  top-leading corner and an angular gradient at three o'clock; both run
  clockwise.
- `View.border(_: BorderEdgeStyle, set:placement:sides:)` and
  `BorderEdgeStyle`. Stack one `border(_:sides:)` for each color. The borders
  join at their corners, and a corner takes the color of the border applied
  last.
- `StrokeStyle.lineWidth` and `StrokeStyle.init(lineWidth:…)`. A stroke is one
  cell wide: SwiftUI's `lineWidth: 1` is a hairline, and the thinnest ink a cell
  holds is a line glyph. For a thick border, fill a shape and fill a smaller one
  inside it with `inset(by:)`. `StrokeStyle.init(borderSet:lineJoin:dash:dashPhase:)`
  is the initializer to use.
- `StrokeStyle.placement`, which nothing read, and the `StrokeStyle.Placement`
  name. The type is now `BorderPlacement`, and `placement: .outset` on
  `View.border` is unchanged.
- The `background:` overloads of `Shape.stroke` and `Shape.strokeBorder`. A
  stroke keeps the background of the cells it draws on, so put a fill or a
  `background` under it.
- `View.border(_:set:placement:sides:)`. Pass a `StrokeStyle`: `set: .double`
  becomes `style: .double`. The `set:` argument no longer has a default. The
  spelling stays for one release so that code can build against both this
  release and the last one.

## [0.13.5] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- Refresh the bundled browser host provenance for coordinated release 0.13.5.
  Framework APIs and behavior are unchanged from 0.13.4.

## [0.13.4] - 2026-09-15

### Changed

- Require Swift 6.4 and use the 6.4.0 toolchain across native, WebAssembly,
  and Android builds. Update strict memory-safety and concurrency annotations
  for the new compiler (STUI-494).
- Keep hot reload and diagnostic tooling on SwiftPM's native build engine,
  preserving the artifact layout those tools consume.

### Fixed

- Preserve child-process PTY output when the child exits before the first
  read, and install Darwin signal replay before handing off signal disposition
  (STUI-184, STUI-185).

## [0.13.3] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- Debug terminal hot reload on macOS and Linux through `swifttui-dev`, with
  serialized builds, stale-edit coalescing, ABI/toolchain checks and a 100-image
  restart boundary. Compatible Codable state, focus, scroll and inactive-tab
  values replay into fresh owners while old lifecycle work retires.

### Fixed

- Route keys from synthetic List-row focus targets through their graph owner,
  preserving single-step selection/focus movement and one activation per key
  (STUI-491).
- Keep pasted spaces from activating controls after enclosing key handlers
  decline the synthesized text.
- Keep finite ScrollView viewports full-sized with short or empty content,
  and allocate spare stack space to unframed scroll views on their scrolling
  axes. Content remains top-leading and content-sized; explicit frames and
  `.fixedSize` retain their sizing constraints (STUI-489).

### Changed

- Focused `onKeyPress`, `onMoveCommand`, and `onExitCommand` handlers now run
  from enclosing views toward the focused target before built-in control
  behavior, matching observed SwiftUI precedence (STUI-492). Parent handlers
  must return `.ignored` to allow descendant handlers and editing/navigation
  defaults to run. Same-identity modifier order remains outermost first.

## [0.13.2] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- Drawing value APIs for angles and arcs, compatible-topology path animation,
  and shape clipping.
- Animated-image loop metadata and finite playback, including GIF round trips.
- Opt-in merge-pressure frame pacing (`SWIFTTUI_MERGE_PRESSURE_PACING=1`)
  and frame-cost/coalescing telemetry. Input, signal, external and due-deadline
  wakes bypass the invalidation-only gap; the feature defaults off.

### Fixed

- Preserve drawing opacity, curved-stroke colors, and raster extents; compose
  overlapping images in authored order across native, web, and terminal hosts.
- Reuse source-owned image content during resolution and encoding.
- Correct control-style rendering and retained content placement, and validate
  public collection-style presentations with deterministic diagnostics.
- Keep wheel-driven invalidations responsive when frame pacing is enabled.
- Reduce nested-scroll regression test cost while retaining endpoint, handoff,
  and reversal assertions under the existing amd64 duration cap.
- Animate numeric text in viewport-realized List rows and refresh eager rows'
  text presentation across retained layout.
- Apply scoped animation and transaction timing to environment-carried
  foreground and tint styles while preserving base-view and sibling isolation.
- Compose nested matched-geometry adoption and interpolation in displayed
  coordinates, including animated sources and frozen descendants.
- Preserve displayed opacity when reinserting a view during its removal fade.
- Complete no-write animation scopes without waiting for an unrelated frame,
  and preserve logical completions when a sibling animation is pruned.
- Settle triggered keyframe and phase animators when Reduce Motion changes
  during a run; restoring motion no longer reveals a stale intermediate value.
- Clear retained matched-geometry adoption offsets when the animation
  controller resets.

- Preserve terminal bytes drained before a POSIX read failure, including Linux
  PTY shutdown, and preserve record separators inside bracketed paste.
- Deliver redirected UTF-8 input and EOF on Windows while keeping idle pipes
  cancellable and console input record-based.
- Acknowledge polling input suspension before terminal handoffs on WASI and
  Windows, and resume input after the external operation completes.

### Changed

- Animate unmarked presence changes with a default opacity transition. An
  explicit `.transition(.identity)` suppresses the corresponding fade.
- `SignalReader` now names the framework-owned `TerminalSignal` value in its
  public API. Existing `UnixSignal` arrays remain source-compatible through
  the vendored module's alias. Signal names and native numbers are unchanged.
- Clarify that `WebHostCLIRunner` installs web support for custom launch code;
  a bare rename to the portable launcher does not perform that installation.

## [0.13.1] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Focus-scoped `onMoveCommand` and `onExitCommand` handlers with explicit
  consumption and bubbling through `KeyPressResult`.

### Fixed

- Preserve authored accessible names when controls apply built-in styles.
- Route nested scroll-wheel input to the appropriate scroll container.
- Preserve authored reference state while tabs are dormant, and certify state
  and observation reads before reusing memoized Equatable subtrees.

- Preserve stacked key handlers on the first Equatable-boundary frame, and
  retain explicit focus changes made by pointer release actions.
- Remember every dismissed bindingless tip for its anchor lifetime, and retain
  parent modal suppression when an inner control is already disabled.
- Keep sheets with scoped exact IDs independent, preserve state when conditional
  portal siblings appear, and retain each chained toast's source environment.
- Place TextEditor hardware and accessibility carets at the current wrapped text
  position on the first frame and after resizing.
- Anchor floating menus to their source controls, including movement and
  viewport-edge clamping.
- Preserve both task operations when chained modifiers collapse onto one
  owner, including independent ID replacement and cancellation on removal.
- Keep retained ForEach row bindings current for mutable reference-backed IDs.
- Scope Table's focus dependency to its own identity so descendant focus moves
  do not force unrelated row-wrapper reconstruction.
- Reject observation checkpoint restoration during active draft recording at
  the restore boundary.

- Keep ancestor scroll extents stable when a nested scroll view moves its
  content, so outer indicators and endpoint clamping use the viewport's size.
- Preserve custom alignment guides in lazy stacks and safe-area insets, and
  align odd-sized custom-layout anchors with `ViewDimensions`.
- Respect fixed-frame minimums and return unused custom-layout offers to
  flexible stack siblings.
- Preserve tall hosted List/Table rows and viewport metadata when retained
  content moves, and honor eager Table scroll anchors after wheel or proxy input.
- Diagnose inset borders that leave no interior cells for nonempty content.
- Bound slow WebSocket clients to 32 records / 4 MiB at each outbound queue,
  including active writes. Overflow closes the affected connection; reconnect
  starts from the latest full frame with image payloads restored. Clipboard,
  runtime issue, and accessibility announcement records stay FIFO, and detached
  control overflow is reported instead of silently evicting older records.

### Changed

- Window compositional lazy-stack content with source-qualified identity and
  fragment-aware default spacing, including multiple authored sources.
- Resolve authored view trees through explicit continuations while preserving
  direct control ownership and bounded iterative cadence.
- Add opt-in retained-cache validation work counters for performance diagnosis.

- Classify framework environment keys through explicit ownership and reader
  certification markers instead of reflected names.
- Move tab selection, focus, overflow and dormancy operations into collaborators
  that retain graph-owned checkpoint and teardown behavior.
- Index task handles by owner and logical descriptor to avoid global scans
  during task startup and owner cancellation.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-09-10

### Removed

- Move the `SwiftTUITerminal` product and SwiftTerm-backed emulation to the
  separate `swift-tui-terminal-view` package. SwiftTerm is no longer a framework
  dependency. To migrate, add that package, change the product dependency to
  `SwiftTUITerminalView` from `swift-tui-terminal-view`, and replace
  `import SwiftTUITerminal` with `import SwiftTUITerminalView`. View and session
  APIs retain their names. `ChildProcessPty` now belongs to the framework's
  `SwiftTUIPTYPrimitives`, which the new umbrella re-exports; its public
  `requestSignal` retains termination requests made during startup.
### Added

- A DocC guide, "The Style System", maps all 28 open style families: the
  four parts every family shares, applying and scoping built-in styles,
  restyling a subtree with one modifier chain, the two kinds of family, a
  table of every family's built-ins and `.automatic` alias, custom styles,
  route wrappers, theme helpers, diagnostics, and testing. Every public
  declaration in the style families now carries reference documentation.
- `PickerStyleConfiguration.focusActive` combines `isFocused` and
  `showsFocusEffect` like every other interactive configuration.
- `StyleEnvironmentSnapshot.groupBoxChrome(prominence:)` and
  `resolvedStyle(for:)` are public, so a custom style can match the built-in
  group-box chrome and foreground resolution.
- `TabViewStylePresentation` and `TabViewOverflowMenuPresentation` are
  `Equatable`, and the four toast built-ins report a fixed `snapshotLabel`.
- `TextFieldStyleConfiguration` exposes `isEnabled`, `isFocused`, and
  `showsFocusEffect` like its sibling configurations, with `focusActive`
  derived from them. The fixture initializer takes the three flags; the
  earlier `focusActive:` spelling remains available, so existing style-library
  tests keep compiling.
- `DisclosureGroupStyleConfiguration.trigger(content:)` is the disclosure
  group's pointer route. The built-in styles wrap their label row in it.

### Fixed

- The style environment snapshot every control hands its style now carries
  the terminal's cell pixel metrics instead of the estimated fallback.
- The `.menu` picker built-in honors `focusEffectDisabled()`: it drew its
  focus rail from `isFocused` alone.
- Toast and tab-view presentations are validated like the other families. An
  out-of-order toast size bound, an oversized padding, an out-of-range or
  repeated tab index, or a negative strip height reports
  `style.invalidPresentation` and renders the automatic presentation instead
  of degrading silently. Portal scroll heights and widths are also checked for
  representability.
- An invalid spinner presentation reports once per invalid style value rather
  than once per animated frame.
- The spinner, list, outline, and table erasers describe themselves by
  snapshot label in `debugDescription`.
- A press on a disclosure group's expanded content no longer collapses the
  group: only the label row (the style's trigger route) toggles expansion,
  and the group's semantic action keeps a zero-size pointer region like
  `Menu`.
- A disabled `.plain` link dims like a disabled `.automatic` link; the plain
  built-in dropped the chrome opacity.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-09-09

### Changed

- Complete the coordinated 0.12 minor release after correcting the GIF-editor
  example's height-floor regression test. The test now verifies clipped
  thumbnails and the terminal-size guard after the bounded-layout fixes in
  0.12.0. Framework behavior is unchanged from 0.12.0.
- Refresh the bundled browser runtime provenance for the matching 0.12.1
  web packages and correct changelog navigation.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-09-08

This minor release completes the control-style follow-ups and fixes layout,
input, animation, collection binding, and lifecycle defects across the hosts.
Public API additions include keyframe-builder control-flow overloads and the
`FrameDropBlocker.taskTransfer` diagnostic case. No ordinary public symbols
were removed since 0.11.3.

### Added

- Bare-keyframe builders support conditionals, loops, and multi-case switches
  while preserving sequential timing, including empty loops.

### Fixed

- Nested menus, popovers, and sheets share presentation ordering with input
  routing, modal focus, Escape dismissal, and focus restoration.
- Duplicate-ID `ForEach` bindings resolve the intended occurrence after
  collection edits. Bindings to removed occurrences cannot overwrite a
  surviving row; versioned lookup avoids repeated indexing for state-backed
  collections.
- Visible lazy-list rows preserve appearance and running tasks when their
  backing nodes change. Task ownership transfers at commit, with safe
  completion handling and cancellation when the row eventually departs.
- Body-producing styles update stored dynamic properties before evaluating
  `makeBody`, including mutations captured by actions and per-control state.
- Closed ControlGroups with value-only state survive enclosing lazy-tab
  dormancy. Menu content retains state and running tasks across style changes;
  omitted content cancels tasks and restarts them on return.
- Scroll drawing and hit testing use the viewport chosen by layout. Overlay
  indicators no longer compete for the corner cell, and inline menus keep
  their Escape handler and keyboard dismissal focus when disabled.
- Wrapped custom layouts retain alignment answers, and each placement pass
  evaluates alignment hooks once. Custom layouts named `Group` or `EmptyView`
  retain their own measurement and placement behavior.
- Spacer-only overlays distribute stack surplus correctly, flexible safe-area
  insets advertise their flexibility, and bounded stacks reserve later
  children's minimum sizes before distributing a deficit.
- Synthetic text-field carets mark the current glyph, including wide and
  masked text. Hover handlers receive exit callbacks when their view or
  modifier disappears, and Escape respects the focused navigation stack.
- Indeterminate progress indicators animate while idle and cancel their tick
  task on removal. Reduced-motion and determinate indicators remain static.
- Stepper input checks the live binding and current bounds before adjusting,
  so inactive controls do not rewrite out-of-range values.
- Deadline-driven gestures deliver updates with their authored transaction.
  Explicit transaction metadata takes precedence over stored binding animation,
  and termination and wheel handlers update the correct focus owner.
- Interrupted insertion and matched-geometry removal start from their visible
  geometry. Geometry-changing animations render their arrival and final frame;
  clipped offset descendants remain visible where their content intersects.
- Removed animation slots discard stale velocity, and completed transitions
  release curve registrations once their final consumer finishes.
- Scroll-position registrations retire with their owner. Live input streams
  adopt changed mouse-coordinate modes without discarding buffered input.
- Capsule tile fills and curved `strokeBorder` backgrounds respect their
  geometry. Narrow table cells truncate oversized graphemes without shifting
  separators, and rich-text decoration clearing has additional regression
  coverage.
- Layout diagnostics accumulate work across late-preference reconciliation
  passes and budget fallback paths.

### Changed

- All style erasers share storage and reuse comparison. Body resolution,
  optional routes, and slider/stepper key and wheel registration share their
  respective implementations.
- Scroll validation reports the presentation variant as well as its style.
  Slider fixture SPI adds the same argument ordering as Stepper fixtures,
  retaining the existing initializer.

## [0.11.3] - 2026-09-07

A re-cut of 0.11.2 with the same framework behaviour. The 0.11.2 tag's
release-configuration test lane crashed in a test harness, so the org's
release contract could not close on that tag; 0.11.3 carries the two repairs
below and nothing else.

### Fixed

- **Input readers finish their event streams only after the descriptor's read
  source is cancelled.** The POSIX reader finished its stream from the event
  handler and cancelled the dispatch source afterwards, so a consumer that
  closed the descriptor as soon as its loop ended could race libdispatch's
  deregistration and crash the manager thread (seen on the Linux release
  soundness lane). Both reader variants now finish from the cancel handler,
  and `liveReadSourceCount` lets tests assert the ordering.

- **The spinner cadence seam is a nominal type.** `SpinnerTaskClock.sleep`,
  the package-visible task-local that tests use to drive `Spinner` ticks, held
  an `async` function value. Binding it in a release build crashed in
  `swift_task_localValuePush` with null value-type metadata on macOS and Linux
  (Swift 6.3.3; debug builds were unaffected). It now holds a `Sleep` struct
  with `callAsFunction`, and tests bind it through `withSleep(_:perform:)`.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- **Bordered group boxes and rounded-border editors are content-sized again.**
  0.11.0 replaced their stack-minimum height hint with a flexible frame, which
  fills any finite height proposal: beside a centered sibling or under a
  fixed-height parent the chrome grew past its content. The hint is back and
  both are pinned against measured heights.
- **The editor caret map wraps at the width its content is placed at.** The
  probe measured the ScrollView, not the content the scroll body proposes one
  cell narrower when it reserves an indicator track, or narrower still under
  scroll-style insets, so vertical caret moves drifted a column in overflowing
  editors.
- **List and Table bodies keep their full hit region.** The 0.11.0 scroll-body
  change also narrowed collection bodies to their content bounds, so a wheel or
  press on a bordered list's border fell through to an ancestor.
- **Standalone links inherit ambient decorations.** An ancestor `underline()`
  or `strikethrough()` reached inline links but not a `Link` view.
- **A `ViewThatFits` in a style body no longer reports false duplicate routes.**
  Every candidate resolves and one is placed; each candidate now claims routes
  on its own ledger, so the placed candidate keeps its pointer target.
- Slider and stepper route wrappers hand their content the documented disabled
  state on the fixture path too, and a continuous slider over a subnormal span
  no longer hangs deriving its steps.
- **`ForEach` rows over observable models render the current model.** Under
  selective updates, an element whose content read an observable model could
  replay its captured text on the next frame while the model advanced. Element
  evaluators now replay their concrete builders under the current frame inputs
  and their live construction owner, and equal-output reuse refreshes the
  producer through its entity route. Eager, enumerated, indexed, scoped,
  portal, and flattened `Group` paths are pinned, along with repeated updates,
  removal, and identity and state stability.
- **Observation registrations survive discarded drafts and checkpoint
  restores.** Recording epochs are monotonic, so a discarded or rolled-back
  draft can no longer be mistaken for a live one, and one synchronized mailbox
  classifies callbacks, holds draft changes, and promotes publication
  atomically. Every body read that shares one identity within a pass remains a
  dependency.
- **Releasing a renderer releases its graph.** Resolve and authoring contexts
  borrow their graph and node owners instead of retaining them, and stored
  evaluators capture the resolver without its coordinator, so a `Resolver`, a
  `DefaultRenderer`, and a removed sheet node release with their owner. A
  fixture that keeps calling handlers after dropping the renderer must retain
  the owner instead.
- **A task cancelled before its first actor turn never runs its operation**,
  and releasing the task owner cancels every retained handle synchronously,
  which covers manually driven runtimes as well as explicit shutdown. Phase and
  keyframe animators seed their trigger history in mounted state, so a trigger
  change that lands between mount and the first task turn is preserved, and
  `Spinner` stops after a cancelled sleep before it touches retired view state.
- **Deep grids no longer pay for a stale measurement witness.** A measurement
  cache hit refreshes its comparison witness only when the traversal certifies
  exact discriminator equality throughout the tree; wildcard-compatible hits
  keep the original witness. A schedule-seeded grid had measured its heavy
  frames at nearly twice the cost of an otherwise identical tree.

### Changed

- **Portal styles are called when the surface presents.** Sheet, cover, and
  popover declarations still read the nearest style while closed, but call and
  validate it only on presentation, like prompts already did, so a closed
  declaration with an invalid style no longer warns on every frame. Anchored,
  sheet, and prompt presentations reject a single inset or minimum width too
  large to add to a terminal extent. `LinkStyle` validates an opacity outside
  the unit range and reports it. Scroll-style and missing-route reports use
  the shared misuse message shape.
- **Event intake is amortized constant-time.** The pump's pending batches are
  a deque, the pointer-batch eligibility check reads one event instead of
  rescanning a growing batch, and one buffered wake token points at the event
  and work queues. No input event, coalescing boundary, or finish signal is
  dropped.
- **Host-wire hyperlink interning is linear.** URL indexes come from a
  dictionary lookup that preserves first-seen order and run layout; a 160×60
  document with 4,800 distinct targets reconstructs all 9,600 cell
  destinations.
- **WebHost browser bundle re-vendored at `swift-tui-web` 0.11.2.**
  Incremental Canvas painting clips to the damage union, decoded images have
  retention budgets with visible-set pinning and explicit disposal, images
  whose identifiers exceed the payload-recovery limit are pinned rather than
  evicted, and glyph ink is clipped to its declared cell span.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- Primitive modifiers now reject direct body evaluation before capture binding.
  This avoids a Swift 6.3.3 optimizer crash when release builds enable actor
  data-race checks, while preserving the normal primitive resolution path.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- Scroll body hit regions follow the styled content viewport, preserving
  direct sub-cell panning alongside separately routed indicator tracks.
- **Scroll and link styles.** `ScrollViewStyle` supplies insets, indicator
  glyphs and paint, opacity, and reserved or overlay tracks. `LinkStyle`
  styles standalone and interpolated links, with explicit underline
  inheritance or removal. Both have generic and erased modifiers and inert
  configuration fixtures. Scrolling, indicator policy, and link actions remain
  primitive-owned. Scroll content now clips to its content viewport so it
  cannot erase reserved indicator tracks, and incremental scroll copies
  repaint changed indicator chrome beside that viewport.
- **Public palette styles.** `PaletteStyle` composes command data through
  public pointer routes, `perform()`, and coordinated dismissal. Opaque command
  identities follow contribution structure, preserving selection across label
  changes and distinguishing duplicates. `DefaultPaletteStyle` retains fuzzy
  ranking, keyboard navigation, and the twelve-row window. Generic and erased
  modifiers preserve `ActionScope`; fixture construction is available by SPI.
  Scoped publication preserves control-owned pointer and hover handlers when
  only their styled route wrappers re-evaluate.
- **Portal presentation styles.** `PromptStyle` shares appearance between
  alerts and confirmation dialogs; `FullScreenCoverStyle` controls cover insets
  and paint; `PopoverStyle` resolves the anchored surface shared with Menu.
  Automatic styles preserve each declaration's baseline. Sheet presentation
  values add content insets and optional background and border paint, while
  retaining the existing initializer. Item-based sheets now honor SheetStyle.
  Five fixed surfaces retain primitive-owned modality, focus, and dismissal.
- **Menu and control-group styles.** `MenuStyle` exposes trigger and portal
  composition while Menu owns activation, expansion, and dismissal. Anchored
  presentation values control insets, bounds, and paints, including scrolling
  for a finite height. `ControlGroupStyle` supplies horizontal, vertical, and
  compact-menu treatments with declaring-owner retention for captured child
  state. The automatic menu's focus rail now honors `focusEffectDisabled`.
- **Slider and stepper styles.** `SliderStyle` and `StepperStyle` expose
  captured labels, framework-formatted values, and public track/action routes.
  Numeric storage, clamping, step rounding, keyboard input, and wheel handling
  remain primitive-owned. Track routes preserve pointer capture during drags;
  stepper routes claim bound presses without activating the opposite action.
  Automatic slider is a fixed linear alias; compact stepper uses minus/plus
  controls without a reserved focus rail. Fixture routes are inert.
- **Bound-control and editor styles.** `ToggleStyle`, `DisclosureGroupStyle`,
  `TextEditorStyle`, and `ProgressViewStyle` expose captured content and current
  render state through public configurations and environment modifiers. Toggle
  and disclosure bindings retain primitive ownership. Editor styles surround
  protected editing content; caret movement follows the styled viewport width.
  New treatments include checkbox and button toggles, compact disclosures,
  plain editors, and circular progress using the nearest spinner style.
  Toggle and disclosure focus rails now honor `focusEffectDisabled`, matching
  their other focus chrome.
- **Semantic control chrome for custom styles.** `StyleEnvironmentSnapshot`
  publicly resolves `controlChrome` and `rowChrome`, keeping theme, focus,
  pressed, and disabled treatments consistent with built-in styles.
- **Label and grouping styles.** `LabelStyle`, `LabeledContentStyle`, and
  `GroupBoxStyle` add environment-scoped composition with public captured
  slots, erased storage, and testing fixtures. Automatic styles preserve
  existing rendering. New treatments include title-only and icon-only labels,
  stacked labeled content, and plain group boxes.
- **Public picker interaction routes.** Custom picker styles receive option
  indices, selection and enabled state, `option.route { … }`, and
  `configuration.trigger { … }`. Every built-in uses these wrappers. Picker
  fixture routes are inert, including when an older fixture supplies a raw
  control identity. Menu triggers now toggle expansion; keyboard activation
  toggles, Escape closes, and an arrow reopens the list while navigating.
- **Style fixtures for tests: `@_spi(StyleFixtures)`.** Every shipped style
  family's configuration (`ButtonStyleConfiguration`,
  `TextFieldStyleConfiguration`, `PickerStyleConfiguration`,
  `ListStyleConfiguration`, `OutlineStyleConfiguration`,
  `TableStyleConfiguration`, `SpinnerStyleConfiguration`,
  `SheetStyleConfiguration`, `ToastStyleConfiguration`,
  `TabViewStyleBodyConfiguration`) and captured slot (the `Label` slots,
  `TextFieldStyleConfiguration.FieldContent`,
  `TabViewStyleBodyConfiguration.Content`) now has a public initializer
  behind `@_spi(StyleFixtures) import SwiftTUIViews`, so a style library's
  test target can construct a configuration with fixture state and resolve
  its style's body or presentation value without a live render. Application
  code never sees the construction surface. The tab-view item and
  overflow-trigger configurations keep their existing public initializers as
  the fixture path. New DocC articles `Authoring-Styles` and `Testing-Styles`
  document the contract and the workflow.
- **Shared route-wrapper contract.** The tab-view route wrappers
  (`TabViewStyleItemConfiguration.route(content:)`,
  `overflowRoute(content:)`, `TabViewOverflowTriggerConfiguration.route(content:)`)
  now run through one package seam that every later interactive family
  reuses: installing the same route more than once in one style body emits a
  `style.duplicateRoute` runtime issue and the first installation stays the
  pointer target; omitting an optional route removes only the pointer target
  and leaves keyboard interaction, which the primitive owns, untouched; and
  routes on a fixture-constructed configuration are inert. Nothing traps.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-09-03

### Changed

- **`ZStack` no longer hands its children the enclosing stack's axis.** A
  `ZStack` resolves its children with no stack axis, the same context that
  `ZStackLayout {}` and a custom `Layout` without a declared orientation
  already install, so the two spellings of a z-stack agree. A `Spacer` directly
  inside a `ZStack` now reserves its `minLength` on both axes rather than on
  whichever axis the enclosing `HStack` or `VStack` used, and a `Divider`
  directly inside follows the proposal's longer side. Sizing is unchanged: a
  `Spacer` beside other children stays layout-neutral and the `ZStack` hugs
  them, which is SwiftUI's behaviour as well. The divergence register's
  `ZStack` entry, which had recorded SwiftUI as making such a spacer flexible
  on both axes, was corrected after measuring against the macOS SDK; the
  per-axis `ViewSpacing` stance is now *Ratified* and the absence of a
  `LayoutSubviews` collection type is recorded as a deliberate omission.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- **Custom `Layout` container contract.** `Layout` gains three defaulted
  members that let a custom container participate in its *parent's* layout
  the way built-in stacks do: `static var layoutProperties: LayoutProperties`
  declares a stack orientation that `Spacer` and `Divider` children observe
  (`HStackLayout` and `VStackLayout` now declare theirs, so
  `HStackLayout { Text("a"); Spacer() }` behaves like `HStack`, and switching
  an `AnyLayout` between the two flips the spacer's axis); `spacing(subviews:
  cache:)` states the container's preferred outer spacing, which the parent
  stack negotiates with (the default is the union of the subviews'
  preferences, so nested declarations flow upward); and two
  `explicitAlignment(of:in:proposal:subviews:cache:)` overloads answer a
  horizontal or vertical guide for the container in its own zero-origin
  bounds, honoured by `VStack(alignment:)`, `HStack(alignment:)`,
  `frame(alignment:)`, and overlays, with an `alignmentGuide` modifier on the
  container still taking precedence. `ViewSpacing` gains `zero`, `union(_:)`,
  and `formUnion(_:)`. Every hook is carried through `AnyLayout` erasure and
  runs on the frame-tail worker with the rest of the layout; answers are
  memoized per pass. A layout that declares no orientation now clears an
  axis inherited from an enclosing stack instead of leaking it into its
  children.

### Changed

- **Named coordinate spaces are identified by their typed name, not by its
  text.** Source-breaking. `CoordinateSpace.named(_:)` and
  `NamedCoordinateSpace.named(_:)` collapsed the `Hashable & Sendable` name to
  `String(describing:)`, so `.named(1)` and `.named("1")` — or two enum cases
  from different enums that print alike — named one space: they resolved
  against the same frame and tripped the duplicate-name diagnostic against
  each other. A named space is now equal only to one built from the same name
  type and value, and the typed value is the key at every step downstream
  (placed-frame table, semantic snapshot, pointer events, gesture and
  `GeometryProxy` resolution). `NamedCoordinateSpace` is declared in
  `SwiftTUIPrimitives` (still reachable through `SwiftTUIViews`), is
  `Hashable`, and exposes the name's text only as `description`, the spelling
  frame diagnostics report. `CoordinateSpace.Kind.named` carries a
  `NamedCoordinateSpace` instead of a `String`,
  `SemanticSnapshot.namedCoordinateSpaces` is `[NamedCoordinateSpace: CellRect]`,
  and `SemanticMetadata.namedCoordinateSpaceName: String?` is now
  `namedCoordinateSpace: NamedCoordinateSpace?` (its public initializer label
  changed with it). Code that only uses the `.named(_:)` factories and
  `View.coordinateSpace(_:)` is unaffected; a string lookup such as
  `namedCoordinateSpaces["board"]` becomes
  `namedCoordinateSpaces[.named("board")]`.

### Fixed

- **A state write no longer fast-forwards in-flight animations on a loaded
  run loop.** Deadline frames deliberately animate to their *scheduled*
  instants, so a loop running slower than the animation cadence lets the
  armed deadline chain lag the wall clock. A frame woken by anything other
  than a deadline — a state write, input, or signal — then sampled animations
  at the wall clock, advancing them by the whole accumulated lag at once: a
  spring with a second left to run completed on the spot and its `.removed`
  completion fired right behind it. The visible shape was a state write from
  an early `.logicallyComplete(after:)` closure appearing to snap the very
  spring it completed for. Wake frames are now clamped to the nearest
  still-armed deadline when that deadline is already due; a loop keeping
  cadence is unaffected.
- **A `ForEach` with a single element no longer hands that element's node up
  as its container's own value.** A one-element `ForEach` resolved to the
  element's node while two elements resolved to a `Group`, so the identity
  index, the task runner, and lifecycle publication all treated the container
  as the element: the element's `@State` re-seeded on the container, an
  imperative write made from a body-created closure (the counter demo's ripple
  `.task`) landed on an orphaned node and the ripple never animated, and
  growing the data to two elements re-rooted the container mid-animation,
  cancelling the surviving element's `.task` and snapping its animation to the
  end value; a second growth could trap a debug build's skip oracle. A lone
  `ForEach`-scoped element now keeps the one-child `Group` its siblings would
  share, so growth is an ordinary child insertion under an unchanged parent.
  Stacks splice that `Group` exactly as they splice a two-child one and
  nothing renders differently; a modifier's content or a conditional branch
  still flattens as before.
- **`.onAppear` and `.onDisappear` handlers run once per frame.** A container
  that spliced a lone `ForEach` element up as its own resolved value carried
  the element's handler IDs in its committed value and published them under
  two identities, so the per-frame dedupe keyed on identity never matched and
  the handler ran twice. The appear and disappear buffers now dedupe on the
  handler ID alone: an ID names one registration.
- **A changed preference reaches every consumer above it on a selective
  frame.** Selective evaluation re-runs only the dirty frontier and serves the
  ancestors from their committed snapshots, so a frame whose re-evaluated node
  committed a changed preference output left every consumer above it stale: a
  `navigationDestination(isPresented:)` push whose write invalidated only the
  modifier rendered nothing, and after any selective frame beneath a
  `NavigationStack` the rebuilt stack carried no pop chain, so Escape found
  nothing to pop. A frame that changes a preference at resolve time now
  escalates to the root evaluator (a root frame's cost, paid only then), and a
  served ancestor's rebuilt snapshot keeps its committed preferences instead
  of re-deriving the plain child aggregate.
- **Presentation overlays keep their modal gate and focus boundary on
  selective frames.** A selective frame rebuilds a served ancestor from its
  children's committed values, and it is a presentation stack's copy of the
  hosted base that carries the modal-overlay interaction gate and the absorbed
  focus-scope boundary, so after a press frame beneath a served stack the
  base's focus and pointer regions were emitted under an open sheet: a click
  behind the sheet reached the base action, and an action-bearing popover tip
  left the base focusable. Both decorations are re-applied on rebuild. In the
  same change, the scoped registration reset beneath an exact `.id` host
  removed nothing (keys live under the resolved identity while the reset
  selected by structural prefix), so a `prefersDefaultFocus` candidate was
  published twice per frame; the reset and the restore now select from one
  node set.
- **A gesture added or removed during an active drag takes effect.** A resolve
  pass registers gestures into the frame head's draft, which meets the live
  registry only at publication; the restore kept the active live recognizer,
  adopted the record's callbacks, and tore the re-authored record down, while
  the pointer route still dispatched through the discarded draft. A root frame
  repaired this on the next frame, but a selective frame never re-evaluated
  the chain, so a tap removed during a drag kept firing and a tap added during
  one never dispatched. The restore now holds the fresher record over the
  active entry and installs it the moment the interaction ends, and the
  pointer route dispatches through the live registry.
- **An exact `.id` beneath another `.id` owner keeps its entity when its node
  re-runs on its own.** A node's stored evaluator re-runs its body from the
  frame head, outside the enclosing resolve pass, and re-installed the
  captured authoring context but not the enclosing entity route, so a re-run
  beneath a `.id(owner)` computed a different entity for the same control and
  re-entered its wrapper across identities: a `Panel`-hosted `TextEditor`
  taking focus tripped the debug stamp-coherence oracle, and without the
  oracle the next paste livelocked. The route is captured with the evaluator
  and re-installed, scope only, on re-run. In the same change, an
  `AnyView`-hosted exact-`.id` control's registrations (its own pointer
  handler, a `Stepper`'s buttons, a `Slider`'s track, a `Picker`'s options)
  were published a second time on every selective key-press frame because the
  out-of-band host never joined the reset roots; reset and restore now share
  one node set.

## [0.9.12] - 2026-08-30

### Added

- **`AnyTransition.scale`.** `.scale` and `.scale(scale:anchor:)` grow an
  inserted view's placed frame from the given factor toward its natural size,
  and shrink a removed one back toward it, around a `UnitPoint` anchor; the
  parameterless form uses SwiftUI's near-zero centered factor. Layout is
  preserved while the transition plays: the interpolated frame rounds to whole
  cells and clips the content already laid out inside it, so the surrounding
  views do not reflow. This closes a documented divergence — the built-in
  transition surface was previously opacity- and offset-based, on the grounds
  that scaling glyphs has no meaning on a cell grid.

### Changed

- **Views, view modifiers, styles, dynamic properties, scenes, and apps must
  now be value types.** Source-breaking. `View`, `ViewModifier`,
  `DynamicProperty`, `ButtonStyle`, `PickerStyle`, `TextFieldStyle`,
  `TabViewStyle`, `Scene`, and `App` each gained a defaulted, never-implemented
  static witness whose class overload is unavailable, so a class conformance
  no longer compiles: "SwiftTUI views must be value types (a struct or an
  enum); a class cannot conform to View". Make the type a `struct` or an
  `enum`. Class-typed *fields* are unaffected — an `@Observable` model, a
  resource handle, or a closure log stored in a view stays exactly as it was.
  The state passes bind each `@State` field's owner into the private container
  copy a body evaluation consumes, and a class instance mounted at two
  identities is shared memory with no such per-mount copy; the invariant makes
  that shape unrepresentable rather than merely diagnosed. A cold-path
  precondition in the reflect-once plan builders is the runtime floor beneath
  the compile-time contract.
- **`DynamicProperty.update(in:)` is now `mutating`, and runs through the
  container copy that the body evaluation consumes.** A custom wrapper can hold
  evaluation-visible state in a plain stored property instead of a reference
  box, and the write is visible to that body and to every closure the body
  creates. A non-mutating implementation still witnesses a `mutating`
  requirement, so every existing conformer compiles unchanged; the break lands
  on the framework's own call sites, which update each field through its bound
  offset instead of extracting a copy — which also removes one
  `any DynamicProperty` box per field per evaluation. The `Mirror` tier cannot
  write back, because a mirror child is a copy and an enum payload has no
  addressable slot, so an enum container and an existential-typed field still
  update a copy. That boundary is stated in the contract and reported in DEBUG
  as the new `dynamic-property-mutation-discarded` soundness oracle.
- **The `state.imperativeSeedFallback` diagnostic names the declaring file.**
  It previously reported only a line and column — the slot ordinal packs the
  declaration's position, and nothing recorded the file — so a warning could
  not be traced to a source without grepping every `@State` in the program.
  `State.init(wrappedValue:)` and `init(initialValue:)` now take
  `fileID: String = #fileID`, which a property wrapper's synthesized init
  resolves at the wrapped property's declaration, and the message names the
  site as `Module/File.swift:line:column`. `StateBox` carries the file as a
  diagnostics-only field: slot identity stays line/column-keyed, so no `@State`
  re-keys.

### Fixed

- **A nested exact `.id` inside a multi-statement `ForEach` row was rebuilt on
  every frame.** A row builder with more than one statement — the segmented
  picker's segment plus its conditional `Divider`, for instance — mints a
  `Group` that is spliced out of the tree, so `ForEach` attaches its row entity
  to the `Group`'s children rather than to the `Group` itself. That stamp
  overwrote a child that had already claimed its own entity through `.id`,
  which dropped the exact entity from the resolved tree (releasing its route at
  the frame barrier) and left the child's committed value holding an entity
  routed to the row's own node. The next frame read that foreign occupant,
  evicted the child's subtree and minted a fresh node in its place. Such a row
  lost its `@State`, re-ran `.onAppear`, and re-published every registration on
  every frame, and its resolved shape alternated between two wrapper levels —
  which a debug build reported as a resolved-tree skip-oracle assertion. The
  row entity now rides only the siblings that own no entity of their own.
- **A memoized body could be served another view's output in release builds.**
  A node that resolved a view the memo layer cannot plan for kept the previous
  frame's captured view value instead of clearing it, so a later frame whose
  value compared equal to that stale witness passed the memo gate and was
  served the intervening frame's committed output. Under a stable `.id`
  alternating between two bodies — a `Canvas` and a `Text` in the reproducer —
  the first body's content survived the swap and stayed on screen. Debug builds
  were unaffected: the memo shadow observer captures every view value on the
  frames it observes, and it observes every frame in debug but 1-in-256 in
  release, so the stale comparison could not arise there.
- **A `@State` that a body only handed out, and never read, could be reclaimed
  mid-frame and re-seed from its authored default.** When a view resolves
  through a single-child branch, the enclosing chain absorbs it and the
  identity reindex shadows its node. The tiebreak that keeps such a shadowed
  node as the identity's state owner was gated on the slot table being
  non-empty, which is a *materialization* signal. A view that reads its state
  only inside a `GeometryReader` closure — realized in the frame tail — and
  writes it from `.onChange` has an empty slot table at reindex, so its node
  was queued as an absorbed shadow and reclaimed during the preview and commit
  barriers, after the tail had already bound a binding to it and materialized
  the slot there. The registered closure then read a dead owner, and the
  re-hosted slot re-seeded: the silent class the tiebreak exists to prevent.
  Ownership now consults claims as well as materialized slots — the update pass
  claims every `@State`, `@FocusState`, and `@GestureState` before the body
  runs, and that claim latches on the persistent state.
- **A frame-tail read of a `ForEach` child source trapped instead of
  succeeding.** The three frame-constant accessors `count`, `identityRoot`, and
  `measurementSignature` read `private let` storage of `Sendable` type, fixed
  on the main actor during `init` and never written again, but they routed
  through a release-checked main-actor guard. The layout worker legitimately
  holds the previous frame's retained index and reads `identityRoot` off every
  live source to decide which indexed subtrees an invalidation touches; that
  read is race-free, and `IndexedChildSource` is declared `Sendable` precisely
  so these values cross. The guard has trapped on it since 2026-06-27, which is
  why `bun run perf:bench` died on SIGTRAP with no output. The three accessors
  no longer take the guard, so the compiler proves the absence of a race rather
  than a precondition trapping on the absence of the main actor; everything
  that touches the caches, the content closure, or the captured mint host keeps
  it, because realizing an element off the main actor is the hazard the guard
  exists for.

## [0.9.11] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- **`ContentTransition`.** `View.contentTransition(_:)` (and
  `EnvironmentValues.contentTransition`) tells the `Text` views beneath it how
  to change when their string changes inside an animated transaction:
  `.numericText(countsDown:)` and `.numericText(value:)` roll each changed
  digit column through the intermediate digits like a counter, dimming it at
  the midpoint, and cross-fade any other changed column; `.opacity` dims the
  old string out and the new string in; `.identity` (the default) cuts. The
  roll is a draw-time substitution on the new string's layout — a length
  change lays out at the new width at once and fades the added columns in —
  so it never re-wraps, a retarget continues from the digit on screen, and
  reduce motion or an unanimated write cuts. SwiftUI's `.interpolate` has no
  cell-grid reading and is not offered (register entry).
- **Co-present matched geometry.** An `isSource: false` instance that shares
  a key with a source on the same screen is now rendered at the source's
  frame every frame — per its own `properties:` and `anchor:`, without an
  animation — and hit-tests and focuses where it is drawn, the SwiftUI rule
  a non-source badge relies on. Adoption is a placed-level override: the
  retained layout baseline and the incremental raster path are untouched, a
  key with zero or several sources adopts nothing, and a departing adoptee's
  exit overlay starts where it was drawn. A sole non-source keeps receiving
  the match when its key swaps to it.
- `Scripts/purge_downstream_build_products.sh <module>` removes the SwiftPM
  products of every module downstream of `<module>` (the surgical form of
  `Scripts/test_all.sh --clean`), and the repo gate prints the command when
  a step crashes by signal after a `SwiftTUIPrimitives`/`SwiftTUIGraph`/
  `SwiftTUICore` source changed since the previous gate.

### Fixed

- **An offset-only transition never played.** `.transition(.slide)`,
  `.move(edge:)`, and `.offset(x:y:)` register a placed-level offset animation
  that only the placed-overlay pass advances — the pass an off-screen-elided
  frame skips. The arriving view starts outside the slot it is about to
  occupy, so it had never been drawn, so every animation deadline read as
  unable to reach the screen and elided; the frozen offset then held the view
  off-screen and kept the next tick elidable. The insertion never appeared at
  all until unrelated input forced a real frame, and a departing view's exit
  overlay stranded off-screen with the frame pump re-arming forever. Elision
  now treats placed-pass-owned work — insertion offsets, matched-geometry
  travel, and exit overlays — as a hard blocker.
- **`move(edge:)` measured its travel against the render surface.** An
  edge-relative move now starts (and ends) one *view* width or height outside
  the moving view's own frame, as SwiftUI does. Inside anything that clips —
  a bordered box, a `ScrollView` page — a small view used to begin a whole
  screen away and cross into view only on its last frame, which read as a pop
  rather than a slide.
- **A co-present non-source no longer flies in from its source** on an
  unrelated animated write: the controller plans no matched animation for a
  non-source whose key has a source in the same frame.
- **`PhaseAnimator` replayed its trigger-mode cycle on every dormant-tab
  return.** The animator now records the trigger it last ran for instead of a
  seen-once flag, so an unchanged trigger does not replay when the tab is
  shown again while a trigger that changed while the tab was dormant runs
  one cycle on re-mount.
- **Animator content read the enclosing view's `@State` seed.**
  `KeyframeAnimator`, `PhaseAnimator`, and `TimelineView` evaluate their
  `content` closure under the authoring context that created it, so a
  `@State` owned by the enclosing view reads (and writes) through its own
  owner during a run.

### Changed

- Internal: the retained-products and incremental-raster gates key on
  transient overlay decoration (exit overlays, insertion and matched
  offsets) instead of on the overlay snapshot being empty.

## [0.9.10] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- **Keyframe animation.** `KeyframeAnimator` (trigger and repeating modes),
  the `View.keyframeAnimator(...)` and `View.phaseAnimator(...)` modifier
  forms over `PlaceholderContentView`, `KeyframeTimeline`, `KeyframeTrack`,
  `LinearKeyframe`/`CubicKeyframe`/`SpringKeyframe`/`MoveKeyframe`, the
  `Keyframes` and `KeyframeTrackContent` protocols with their builders, and
  the `UnitCurve` and `Spring` value types (also accepted by
  `Animation.timingCurve(_:duration:)` and `Animation.spring(_:)`). A
  retriggered animator restarts from its current value and carries velocity
  into a leading cubic or spring keyframe.
- **Transactions.** `Transaction(animation:)`, the key-path
  `withTransaction(_:_:_:)`, `View.transaction(value:_:)`, the scoped
  `View.animation(_:body:)` and `View.transaction(_:body:)` forms,
  `Transaction.addAnimationCompletion(criteria:_:)` (any number of
  completions per transaction, each at its own barrier),
  `Animation.logicallyComplete(after:)`, and `Transaction.tracksVelocity`.
- **Matched geometry.** `matchedGeometryEffect(id:in:properties:anchor:isSource:)`
  gains `properties:` (`MatchedGeometryProperties`) and `anchor:`. The new
  parameters have defaults, so `matchedGeometryEffect(id:in:isSource:)` call
  sites keep compiling; the symbol itself (and
  `MatchedGeometryConfig.init`) is renamed in the public API baseline.

### Changed

- **Matched-geometry swaps play the pair's `.transition`s.** A swap used to
  consume both instances' transitions: the departing instance was cut on the
  swap frame and the arriving one appeared at full opacity. The departing
  instance's exit overlay now travels to the destination rect while its
  removal phase plays, and the arriving instance's insertion phase plays from
  the source rect, so `.transition(.opacity)` on both cross-fades the pair
  along one path (SwiftUI parity). Swaps without a registered transition are
  unchanged.
- **Matched geometry interpolates size (default `properties: .frame`).** A
  matched pair whose slots differ in size previously snapped to the
  destination size; it now resizes by bounds and clip at the placed level,
  with coextensive decoration descendants following. Pass
  `properties: .position` for the earlier translation-only behavior.
- **Retargeted built-in springs carry velocity.** A spring retargeted
  mid-flight continues with its current velocity instead of restarting at
  rest. `SWIFTTUI_ANIMATION_VELOCITY=0` restores the at-rest restart for one
  release.
- **Overlapping `withAnimation` completions all fire.** Completion
  registrations are list-valued per batch with per-closure barriers; a
  second registration on the same batch no longer replaces the first.
- **Spring completion requires the velocity to settle too.** A spring no
  longer reports completion at a zero crossing it is still moving through
  (an underdamped bounce, or a spring released toward its target), so
  bouncy springs finish where they actually come to rest.
- **Stroke borders keep the background beneath them.** A `stroke` or
  `strokeBorder` with no explicit `background:` no longer infers each edge
  cell's background from the neighbouring cell outside the ring. The glyph
  carries no background of its own and composites over whatever the cell
  already holds. A ring drawn over an un-inset fill now shows that fill
  (inset the fill by the stroke width, as the built-in control chrome does,
  to leave the ring on the surrounding surface), and a ring on bare surface
  stays bare. Explicit `BorderBackgroundStyle`s are unchanged. With no
  cross-cell read left in the rasterizer,
  `Rasterizer.strokeSamplingDamageClosure` (0.9.9) is removed.

### Fixed

- A highlighted or filled neighbour no longer bleeds into a control's border.
  A selected list row directly above a `TextField`, or a focused `Toggle` row
  above one, painted its background across the field's top edge because the
  edge sampled the row above it; a later-painted control below a ring did the
  same to the bottom edge. Same mechanism as swift-tui#5, now removed rather
  than replayed.

- Exit-transition `.removed` completions fire on the controller's own turn. Once the overlay had faded out, every following deadline frame was elided, and an elided frame runs no placed pass, so the purge that releases `.removed` waited for the next outside input. The purge now runs at the head tick after the one-turn hold (`AnimationController.applyInterpolations`).

## [0.9.9] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **DEBUG trap "incremental raster mismatch" under a stroked border ring**
  ([#5](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui/issues/5)). A rectangle stroke
  with no explicit background (a `strokeBorder` overlay, a `.bordered` button,
  any `.border`) infers each edge cell's background from the neighbouring cell
  outside the ring. That read depends on paint order, and the incremental
  rasterizer replayed a ring whose edge row was dirty against a clean
  neighbour row holding the *previous* frame's final cells — so a border
  sitting directly above or below a later-painted control (a Button under a
  focus ring inside a sheet, in the report) repainted with a different
  background than a fresh raster and tripped the DEBUG oracle; release builds
  showed the stale cell instead. The rasterizer now closes the dirty set over
  the rows a repainting stroke edge samples, so both paths replay them in
  authored order.

## [0.9.8] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- **`Ctrl+C` reliably exits while a text input is focused.** A modified exit
  chord declined by the focused editor (nothing selected to copy) could fall
  through to a legacy key-event fallback that dropped the modifier, inserted
  a literal character, and swallowed the exit. The fallback path is gone: a
  modified press is either handled as the documented edit or exits.

### Performance

- **Resolve-path constants paid down.** Cached path hashes for the
  reconciliation layer's hottest keys (child identities now mint in constant
  time instead of re-hashing the whole path) and an allocation-free
  committed-value anchor walk with an equality early-out. Large-tree frames
  resolve 14-17% faster, retained-reuse frames up to 48% faster, with
  per-node cost flat across tree size.

### Changed

- **The default exit key is `Ctrl+C` (was `Ctrl+D`).** `ExitKeyBindings.default`
  now binds `Ctrl+C` alone; `Ctrl+D` no longer ends a session unless an app
  configures it with `WindowGroup.exitOnKey(.character("d"), modifiers: .ctrl)`.
  The terminal runs in raw mode, so `Ctrl+C` still arrives as a key press, not
  `SIGINT` — previously it was delivered to the app and, unhandled, did nothing,
  while `Ctrl+D` collided with half-page-down in pagers and delete-forward in
  line editors. Consumer `keyCommand`s and non-edit focused `onKeyPress`
  handlers keep precedence over the exit bindings, and `onTerminationRequest`
  can still cancel the exit. Under text-edit focus the rule is now: a
  *modified* exit chord reaches the focused editor first, but only as an edit —
  `Ctrl+C` copies a non-empty selection and the session continues, and with
  nothing selected it exits; a bare character configured as an exit key still
  exits before the editor can insert it. Correspondingly, a text input's
  `Ctrl+C` counts as handled only when there was a selection to copy (cut and
  paste still consume their chords unconditionally).

## [0.9.7] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- **A `@MainActor` app builds under the `ApproachableConcurrency` upcoming
  feature** (the Swift 6.4 `swift package init` default). `SwiftTUICommand`
  now restates `Decodable.init(from:)` as an explicitly `nonisolated`
  requirement, so a conformer's compiler-synthesized initializer -- and with
  it the type's `Decodable` conformance -- is inferred nonisolated instead of
  main-actor-isolated under `InferIsolatedConformances`. An isolated
  conformance cannot satisfy `ParsableArguments`' `Self: Decodable`, because
  that protocol refines `SendableMetatype`, so every `struct MyApp: App` used
  to fail with "main actor-isolated conformance of 'MyApp' to 'Decodable'
  cannot satisfy conformance requirement for a 'SendableMetatype' type
  parameter 'Self'". Apps need no change. A hand-written `init(from:)` on an
  `App` or `SwiftTUICommand` conformer must now be marked `nonisolated` (it is
  the initializer swift-argument-parser already calls from nonisolated code).
  `SwiftTUIArgumentsTests` now compiles with `ApproachableConcurrency`, so
  every command fixture exercises the consumer default. (swift-tui#6)
- **A selected `List` or `Table` row no longer loses focus across a snapshot
  rebuild.** `List` and `Table` stamp each row's role and selectability onto
  their own copy of the row at resolve time, and every row focus region is
  derived from that stamp; a frame served by `ViewNode.snapshotRebuilding`
  re-pulled each row's committed value without it, so the semantics pass
  emitted zero row focus regions, focus cleared, and the convergence render
  re-seated it on row 0 -- Down, an inert key, then Return activated row 0
  while the selection still showed the chosen row. The rebuild now carries
  the parent-authored stamp from the parent's committed slice onto the
  rebuilt child. (swift-tui#4)
- **`state.duplicateSlotClaim` no longer fires for a container whose update
  pass was reuse-served.** The dynamic-property update pass records a
  container's slot claims before the reuse door, and a reuse-served resolve
  never reached `beginEvaluation`'s per-evaluation reset — so the claim a
  served `ScrollView`, `TimelineView`, or popover-tip modifier left behind
  collided with its next evaluation's (legitimately new) box and reported
  phantom sharing. The claim window now opens at the update pass.
- **Dormant-tab archives accept SIMD vectors and Foundation value types.**
  `[SIMD2<Float>]` (its lanes reflect as a `Builtin.Vec…` leaf) and
  `Identifiable` rows keyed by `UUID` (an empty custom mirror) were rejected
  as non-value payloads, so `TabView` restarted that state on every return
  and reported `tab.dormantStateUnsupportedValue` on every departure. SIMD
  conformers are accepted as leaves and Foundation's value-type mirrors are
  trusted like the standard library's; Objective-C class wrappers are now
  rejected by metadata kind like every other class.
- **`TextEditor` no longer reports its measured-width scratch as
  unsupported dormant state.** The reference-typed carrier is declared
  transient for dormancy (framework-internal `@State` policy), so a
  departing tab neither archives nor warns about it.
- **A toolbar item that departs under a frontier-scoped frame is torn down
  and unpublished.** When the item set changes because the content changed
  (a `TabView` selection flip under a `.toolbar()` scope), the strip is
  rebuilt in the late-preference stage outside the dirty plan; the departed
  item's nodes stayed live, its action stayed in the live registry (the
  `registration-publication` residual `live=1 rebuilt=0`), and the presented
  strip lagged until some later root frame. The reconcile now schedules a
  follow-up frame rooted at the host so it re-applies through the normal
  plan.

### Changed

- **The memo-soundness alarm names the diverging node.** The
  `memo shadow oracle` detail now carries the node's identity path and view
  type instead of a bare field name.
- **The DEBUG incremental-raster mismatch trap names its evidence.** The
  `IncrementalRasterMismatch` assertion (and the `raster-damage` probe
  detail) now carries the damage rows the incremental path trusted and, for
  the first mismatched rows, the text each side produced -- or the columns
  whose cell styles differ, or which non-cell field diverged -- plus what the
  trap means and the `SWIFTTUI_SOUNDNESS_PROBE=0` opt-out. The journey from
  swift-tui#5 (a segmented row of `.bordered` Buttons changing selection) is
  pinned as a regression test that reaches the incremental rasterizer with
  zero oracle growth. (swift-tui#5)

## [0.9.6] - 2026-08-22

### Changed

- **`@State` ownership is now bound at capture time.** Closures created
  during body evaluation (actions, tasks, submit handlers, gesture
  closures) carry their state owner the way a `Binding` carries its
  accessors, instead of re-deriving ownership from the ambient dispatch
  context at fire time. A closure fired after a structural churn re-minted
  its owner's node (list reshape, unmount/remount) re-addresses through a
  fire-time identity refresh and observes the live occupant's state. This
  retires the silent-stale-`@State` corruption class for good: the
  registration-time ambient ladder (ancestor walk, sole-live-binding, and
  imperative mint tiers) is deleted, and an access nothing can serve reads
  the authored seed loudly — as a runtime issue and the new
  `state-seed-fallback` soundness violation — never another owner's slot
  silently. `SWIFTTUI_STATE_CAPTURE_BINDING=0` disables the bind pass as a
  diagnostic A/B lever. No public API changed.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **A modifier-less `.keyCommand` binding now says why it never fires.** The
  framework reserves bare keys for typing and built-in navigation and
  ignores such registrations (function keys excepted); that drop used to be
  silent. It now records a `keyCommand.modifierlessIgnored` runtime warning
  naming the command and the fix (add a modifier).

- **`state.duplicateSlotClaim` now names both claimants.** The warning
  reports each claiming wrapper (kind and value type), the node token, and
  the evaluation depth — enough to tell an app-side composed wrapper (fix:
  conform it to `DynamicProperty`) from two framework primitives routed
  through one node (a framework identity-aliasing defect to report).

### Fixed

- **Action closures no longer silently observe stale `@State`.** A handler
  registered with no ambient authoring context (`.onSubmit` and peers
  constructed outside a resolve pass) used to *clear* the dispatch context at
  fire time instead of preserving the caller's, so `@State` reads inside the
  closure silently fell back to the authored initial value — the field
  rendered the typed text while the submit closure read the seed. A nil
  registration snapshot now preserves the ambient dispatch context. Any
  imperative `@State` access that still bottoms out at the authored seed on
  a previously graph-bound box now records a `state.imperativeSeedFallback`
  runtime warning naming the declaration site, instead of failing silently.

- **`ScrollView(.vertical)` no longer forces its pane to the unwrapped text
  width.** In a horizontal layout (pane/sidebar shells), a stack measures
  each child's ideal with an unspecified cross dimension, so a vertical
  scroll view's text content measured unwrapped — and the scroll view then
  republished that unwrapped ideal as a hard structural *minimum*, making
  the pane rigid at the unwrapped width and painting it through the parent's
  border. The non-scrolling axis now reports the content's structural
  minimum instead (a `Text` keeps its zero horizontal minimum inside a
  vertical scroll view), so the pane compresses to the available width and
  the text wraps there. Plain vertical stacks were never affected.

- **The default `List` style no longer draws rows over its own border.** For
  box-drawing styles (`.automatic`/`.insetGrouped`), the top and bottom
  border rows were modeled as scrollable blank lines inside the row stream,
  so an overflowing list slid a real row onto the border row and the row
  erased the border's horizontal run (corner glyphs survived in the side
  columns). The vertical content insets are now layout-bearing — matching
  the horizontal axis, the `.wholeList` chrome scope, and what
  `measuredListIdealSize` already reserved — and the stroked box expands
  back into those reserved rows, with overflow indicators on their own
  lines inside the box. Scroll routing now publishes the inset content band
  for materialized (sectioned) lists too, so anchor arithmetic agrees with
  the drawn window. Behavior change: an overflowing boxed list shows the
  rows that actually fit inside its border (previously one row rendered
  under the border); non-overflowing lists are unchanged, and `.plain` is
  unaffected.

- **Runtime warnings no longer paint over the running app.** The terminal
  CLI's `RuntimeIssueSink.standardError` used to write straight to fd 2 —
  the same tty as the owned alternate screen — so each warning spliced into
  the frame it described (often inside the focused field, where
  `cursorFollowsFocus` parks the hardware cursor) and desynchronized the
  incremental-damage baseline until a full repaint. The sink is now
  screen-aware: while a terminal session owns the screen, issues append to
  `runtime-issues.log` in the active debug bundle (`SWIFTTUI_DEBUG_DIR` /
  `--debug`), or are held in a bounded buffer flushed to stderr after
  teardown restores the primary screen — including for sessions that end by
  throwing. Behavior without an owned screen is unchanged. One visible
  delta: `2>warnings.log` on an interactive session now captures the
  deferred issues at exit rather than live.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-08-18

### Changed

- **The published documentation is reorganized around app authors.** The
  combined DocC archive no longer publishes two plumbing modules whose types
  app code never names (`SwiftTUIPTYPrimitives`, `SwiftTUICLIAttach`); the
  intentional omissions are recorded in the archive manifest and mirrored in
  `.spi.yml`. The `SwiftTUI` umbrella catalog gains an All Guides index
  article that collects every developer guide by task, and its landing page
  curates it. The engine-layer landing pages (`SwiftTUIGraph`,
  `SwiftTUICore`, `SwiftTUIPrimitives`) now open by signposting that apps
  reach their vocabulary through re-export rather than direct imports. The
  Coming-From-SwiftUI and Runtime-Render-Pipeline articles cross-link their
  website counterparts. Reference documentation for every symbol that
  surfaces in app code is unchanged.

### Removed

- **The unimplemented verbosity surface is gone.** `--verbose`/`-v` and
  `--quiet` were advertised in every `SwiftTUICommand` app's `--help` (and
  `SWIFTTUI_VERBOSE`/`SWIFTTUI_QUIET` in the environment-variable reference)
  but never controlled any framework logging: the resolved
  `RuntimeConfiguration.verbosity` was only echoed into the debug-bundle
  manifest. The flags, the env vars, `RuntimeConfiguration.Verbosity`, the
  `verbosity` property/initializer parameter, and `Builder.verbosity(_:)`
  are removed rather than left as dead surface. Apps that want a verbosity
  flag can declare their own; the `--verbose`, `-v`, and `--quiet` names are
  no longer reserved by the framework.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-08-18

Chart fixture refresh only; no framework behaviour change.

### Fixed

- **swift-tui-charts' ascii preview fixtures track the 0.9.2 degradation
  map.** The 0.9.2 release candidate caught five stale `preview-ascii`
  fixtures in the charts repository: rendered against the pre-0.9.2 map,
  they still expected `?` where sparkline ramps, legend markers, heat
  strips, the calendar heatmap, and line-chart area fills now draw real
  ASCII. The fixtures are regenerated; framework code is unchanged from
  0.9.2.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-08-18

### Added

- **Windows is a supported terminal platform.** `import SwiftTUI` + `@main`
  builds and runs natively on Windows 10 1809+ (build 17763) / Windows
  Server 2019+ for `aarch64-` and `x86_64-unknown-windows-msvc`, with no
  platform conditional in app code. Terminal control drives the Win32 console
  directly: VT processing with the session owning the UTF-8 code pages (both
  console modes and both code pages restored on exit), input read as console
  records (`ReadConsoleInputW`) and re-linearized into the same VT byte
  stream the parser consumes on POSIX — which is what makes typed non-ASCII
  text reliable on every supported Windows version, where the console's
  byte-oriented read path is not — resize through the record pump, Ctrl+C
  in-band as `0x03`, and legacy-conhost mouse records translated to SGR so
  mouse works in both Windows Terminal and `conhost`. On Windows the
  `SwiftTUI` umbrella serves the terminal launch surface only: `--web`, PTY
  embedding, and `--attach` remain POSIX. About 5,400 tests run natively
  green, and a two-arch Windows CI lane (full build plus serial test lanes,
  warnings-as-errors) now guards the port.
- **Automatic stack-floor handling on Windows.** A default-linked Windows
  executable reserves 1 MiB of main-thread stack (POSIX mains get 8 MiB). At
  session start the runtime measures the reserve and arms the stack-lean
  resolve profile below the 8 MiB full-engine floor; a debug build that
  degrades emits a `windows.stack-floor-lean-profile` runtime issue naming
  the remedy (`swift build -Xlinker /STACK:16777216`). An explicit
  `SWIFTTUI_STACK_LEAN_PROFILE` value overrides the automatic choice.
- **Platform-aware terminal capability detection.** Detection now has
  per-platform arms. On Windows the platform is the signal — Unicode glyphs
  and 24-bit color by default, because the session controller owns VT
  processing and the UTF-8 code pages — while `NO_COLOR` still wins, an
  explicit foreign `TERM` reads like the POSIX arm, and `WT_SESSION` adds
  OSC 8 hyperlinks and synchronized output. POSIX detection is unchanged.
- **A total ASCII degradation map for box drawing.** Every glyph in the
  box-drawing (U+2500–U+257F) and block-elements (U+2580–U+259F) ranges plus
  `■` now has an ASCII fallback, on every platform — heavy half-stubs, tees,
  and crossings no longer degrade to `?` at the ascii glyph rung.

### Changed

- **The CLI layer is re-cut for portability; every existing import keeps
  working.** `SwiftTUICLI` split into the portable `SwiftTUITerminalCLI`
  (launch) and the POSIX-only `SwiftTUICLIAttach` (PTY + scene attach) over
  a new internal syscall facade, with `SwiftTUICLI` remaining as an
  `@_exported` compatibility facade. SwiftTerm is isolated behind the new
  `SwiftTUITerminalEmulation` target, and the PTY/SwiftTerm dependency edges
  are platform-conditional, so Windows builds never attempt them. Launch
  routing moved to `SwiftTUITerminalCLI.SwiftTUILauncher`;
  `WebHostCLIRunner` remains as a source-compatible facade (its formal
  deprecation is deferred to a later release).

### Fixed

- **A windowed-measurement worker crash under filtered parallel test runs
  (all platforms).** The retained lazy-stack snapshot could read a retained
  live source's measurement signature on the frame-tail worker; the guard
  now refuses retained-live-source reads off the main actor.
- **`Image(fileURLString:)` resolves drive-lettered file URLs on Windows.**
  The Foundation-free file-URL parser returned `/C:/…`-shaped paths, which
  the filesystem rejects; the Windows arm strips the leading slash.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-08-16

Android tooling fixes only; no framework behaviour change.

### Fixed

- **The `sh.swifttui.android` Gradle plugin no longer requires `swiftly` on
  `PATH`.** Both Swift tasks ran a bare `swiftly` command line, so an IDE
  launched from the desktop — which inherits the login daemon's `PATH`, not a
  shell profile's — failed with `Cannot run program "swiftly"` on machines
  where swiftly is installed and the same build succeeds from a terminal. The
  plugin now resolves an absolute launcher (`SWIFTLY_BIN_DIR`, then
  `~/.swiftly/bin`, then `PATH`) and reports the cause instead of surfacing the
  raw `IOException` when none is found. New `swiftTuiAndroidHost.swiftlyExecutable`
  names a launcher explicitly; it is never silently overridden by a discovered one.

- **The plugin no longer mirrors a swift-tui checkout it happened to find.**
  `swiftTuiCheckout` defaulted to the relative path `../../../swift-tui`, which
  resolves *outside* the consumer's project — so an unrelated clone sitting
  there silently replaced the tagged dependency the app's `Package.swift`
  declares. It is now opt-in through `SWIFTTUI_LOCAL_CHECKOUT`.

### Known issue

- The counter demo's `AndroidExample/SwiftPackage/Package.resolved` ships
  pinning `0.9.0`. The manifest requires `exact: "0.9.1"`, so SwiftPM
  re-resolves on first build; the tag was not moved to correct it.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-15

### Changed — source-breaking (0.9 preview readiness)

The preview-readiness closure deliberately narrows two extension points before
they become compatibility promises:

| Removed or changed | Replacement |
| --- | --- |
| `DynamicProperty.mutating update()` | `DynamicProperty.update(in:) -> DynamicPropertyUpdateResult`. The nonmutating contract supports reference-backed or composed graph storage, conservative reuse certification, and lifetime-scoped async invalidation. Plain value mutation now fails to conform instead of being silently discarded. |
| Public `Transition` / `TransitionContent` custom-transition authoring and `AnyTransition.init(_:)` | The implemented built-in `AnyTransition` palette: opacity, move, offset, combined, and asymmetric effects. |

### Changed — source-breaking (control-style Phase A)

Phase A of the control-style expansion empties the program's break inventory
(plan `2026-08-12-002`). Every removal below ships with its replacement in
the same release; there are no deprecated aliases or transitional overloads,
so each migration is a deterministic source edit.

| Removed | Replacement |
| --- | --- |
| `ListStyle`/`OutlineStyle` protocol shape (`resolvePresentation(for:)` entry point, new configurations, `Hashable` dropped); `CollectionStylePresentation`; `Table` reading `listStyle` | The `TableStyle` family (`tableStyle(_:)`, `TableStyleConfiguration`, `TableStylePresentation`, `AnyTableStyle`) plus rewritten list/outline built-ins; `ListStylePresentation` and `TableStylePresentation` replace the combined presentation |
| `ASCIIOutlineStyle`, `.outlineStyle(.ascii)`, `.asciiLineCompass` | None — glyph degradation is the rasterizer's fallback and was never a style-layer concern |
| `Spinner(set:stage:interval:)`, `Spinner(_:stage:interval:)`, public `Spinner.SpinnerSet` | `Spinner(stage:)` plus `spinnerStyle(_:)`; custom frames use `GlyphSpinnerStyle` |
| `.toolbar(style:)` | `.toolbar()` plus `toolbarStyle(_:)` on the toolbar host or any ancestor scope |
| `ToastStyle`'s entry point | Renamed to `@MainActor resolvePresentation(for:)`; the configuration additionally carries `styleEnvironment`, `terminalSize`, `stackIndex`, and `stackCount` |
| Public `PresentationChrome` and its case selection | The `SheetStyle` family (`.surface`, `.dropdown`) over a `defaultPresentation` baseline |
| `paletteSheet(_:isPresented:onDismiss:content:)` and public `ActivePaletteCommand` | Contentless `paletteSheet(_:isPresented:onDismiss:)` — the framework renders the palette (filter field, fuzzy-ranked rows, descriptions, disabled rows, empty-scope message). A public `PaletteStyle` for replacing that rendering is deliberately deferred; it is additive and arrives without a further break. |

### Fixed

- **`onChange` inside presented content no longer skips under the
  synchronous frame driver.** `onChange` is the only lifecycle family whose
  registration is conditional, so a convergence re-render that resets a
  node's recorded handlers without re-triggering left the committed change
  entry with nothing to dispatch. The retained handler store is the designed
  remedy and the asynchronous driver has always fed it; the synchronous
  driver — every synchronous test harness, and the Android host in `.sync`
  render mode — did not. Asynchronously-driven hosts were unaffected.

### Changed — behavior-breaking

- **Ambient propagation for `lineLimit`, `truncationMode`, `.opacity`,
  `underline`, and `strikethrough`.** The `View` modifiers stop being
  node-local no-ops on containers and adopt SwiftUI's ambient contract.
  `lineLimit(_:)`/`truncationMode(_:)`/`textWrappingStrategy(_:)` are now
  environment writes (public `\.lineLimit` and `\.truncationMode` readers
  included): `VStack { … }.lineLimit(1)` clamps every descendant text, the
  innermost write wins, and `.lineLimit(nil)` clears an inherited limit —
  previously a silent no-op. The raw authored value rides the environment;
  text layout clamps non-positive limits to one line (verified against
  macOS SwiftUI). `View.underline()`/`.strikethrough()` propagate the same
  way, with a directly-styled `Text` — including an explicit
  `.underline(false)` — winning over the inherited style. `TextEditor`
  ignores ambient text-layout attributes, matching SwiftUI. Layouts that
  relied on the container no-ops will change.
- **`.opacity` is a multiplicative draw cascade.** Every emitted draw
  command now carries the product of the `.opacity` factors on its ancestor
  chain including the node's own: `container.opacity(0.3)` fades the whole
  subtree, nested fades multiply (0.4 × 0.5 = 0.2), and the explicit-reset
  pattern (`.opacity(0.4)` … `.opacity(1)`) yields 0.4 instead of 1.0 —
  the same-node metadata merge multiplies instead of replacing. Shape
  fills, strokes, rules, borders, canvas foregrounds, list/table chrome, and
  still-image attachments now honor the factor too (a `.opacity` directly on
  a shape or image leaf was previously dropped). Image alpha is transported
  through terminal, browser/WASI, SwiftUI-host, and Android presentation;
  retained draw reuse verifies the inherited factor before serving a cached
  subtree, so an ancestor-only fade repaints descendants correctly.
- **List/Table rows honor authored text attributes.** Authored or ambient
  `lineLimit`/`truncationMode` now reach hosted rows and table cells
  (`Table`'s hosted cells default to single-line tail truncation instead of
  clobbering authored values), and the flattened payload boundary carries
  the attributes (`ListItemPayload`/`TableCellPayload` gain
  `lineLimit`/`truncationMode`). The default row limit remains 1. Flattened
  section chrome honors truncation but clamps limits above one with a
  `collection.unsupportedSectionChromeLineLimit` runtime issue.

### Removed

- **`View.erasedToAnyView`.** The convenience accessor duplicated
  `AnyView(_:)` while reading as an endorsement of stored erasure, which the
  AnyView policy discourages. Call `AnyView(myView)` directly where local
  branch unification genuinely needs it.
- **The `SwiftTUITerminalWorkspace` product.** The tabbed/split-pane workspace
  layer moved out of the framework and now lives in the
  [`terminal-workspace` example](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-examples/tree/main/terminal-workspace)
  in `swift-tui-examples`, built on the unchanged public `SwiftTUITerminal`
  surface. Apps that imported `SwiftTUITerminalWorkspace` can vendor that
  example's `TerminalWorkspace` target sources directly.

### Added

- **`Binding` projections and the optional-binding init family.**
  `Binding.animation(_:)` and `Binding.transaction(_:)` return bindings
  whose writes run inside a stored `Transaction`; the stored transaction is
  a public `transaction` property (SwiftUI's shape) and propagates through
  `dynamicMember` member projections. Precedence is verified against real
  SwiftUI: an explicit ambient scope (`withAnimation`/`withTransaction`)
  wins over the stored transaction; the stored transaction governs writes
  made outside any explicit scope — which is how every built-in control
  writes, so `Toggle(isOn: $flag.animation(.default))` animates with no
  per-control changes. New initializers: `init?(_:)` (optional unwrap; nil
  base fails construction, and a read after the base became nil traps with
  a diagnostic — SwiftUI traps there too), `init(_:)` (optional wrap; nil
  writes are ignored, matching SwiftUI), and `init(projectedValue:)`.
- **`Transaction.isContinuous`.** Author-facing continuity metadata:
  transforms installed with `.transaction(_:)` observe it on both the
  authored channel and `withTransaction`-scoped writes. The framework
  neither sets nor consumes it yet; it carries no animation intent, so a
  continuity-only transaction does not defeat frame elision or the
  controller's resolved-tree skip.
- **Custom `TransactionKey` values.** The `EnvironmentKey` shape for
  transactions: declare a key with a `defaultValue`, then read or write
  `transaction[MyKey.self]`. `Value` requires `Hashable & Sendable`
  (narrowed from SwiftUI's unconstrained associated type; recorded in the
  divergence register). Key values ride authored transforms and scoped
  writes, and participate in retained-reuse equivalence — a per-frame-
  varying key value destroys retained reuse below the writer, the same
  hazard class as an unequatable environment value.
- **`GestureState` reset transactions.** `init(wrappedValue:resetTransaction:)`,
  `init(initialValue:resetTransaction:)`, and the `reset:` closure variants
  (`(Value, inout Transaction) -> Void`, receiving the value being reset).
  The reset transaction governs the end-of-gesture seed reset exclusively —
  verified against SwiftUI: a transaction mutated in the `updating` body
  does not carry over to the reset, and without a reset transaction the
  reset snaps. Resolve-time resets (recognizer teardown, subtree removal)
  never animate.

- **`DynamicProperty` — a total custom-property-wrapper extension point.**
  `update(in:)` runs nested-first before the graph's sole retained-reuse door
  on every body and primitive evaluation surface. Its result certifies
  `unchanged`, reports `changed`, or defaults third-party storage to
  conservative `uncertified`; a transitive subtree bit carries that decision
  through retained reuse without walking the live graph. Built-in wrappers
  preserve the cheap certified path and path-qualified composed storage.
  `DynamicPropertyContext` supplies a graph/node/generation-scoped async
  invalidation lease whose callbacks become inert after supersession,
  rollback, wrapper departure, subtree removal, or graph retirement.

- **Dormant `TabView` state.** Deselecting a tab tears down its body, render
  tree, tasks, registrations, gestures, and observation edges while archiving
  only persistent graph-owned value slots. Reselecting the same stable tag
  within the same tab-owner lifetime restores state before body evaluation;
  inactive bodies remain unevaluated, and removed tags or owner replacement
  evict the archive. Persistent slots that contain a class, task/native object,
  closure/binding, unmanaged reference, or pointer are not retained across the
  dormant seam; the runtime emits `tab.dormantStateUnsupportedValue` with a
  remedy to use recursively value-only state or hoist ownership above the tab.

### Changed — preview behavior

- **Stable captured output is separate from accessibility reduce motion.**
  CI/non-TTY detection and the new stable-output option make built-in animated
  presentation deterministic without changing what app code reads from
  `accessibilityReduceMotion`. Only explicit user/host reduce-motion input sets
  the accessibility preference; built-in animation consults the combined
  rendering policy.

- **Picker degradation is fail-loud.** A tagged, unmodified `Text` remains the
  lossless option shape. Unsupported option structure or modifiers keep their
  extracted text and tag routing but emit one deduplicated
  `picker.unrepresentableOptionContent` runtime issue per option identity.

- **Live ancestor `GestureMask` changes refresh retained descendants.** The
  exact suppression scope now participates in reuse currency, so ordinary,
  high-priority, and simultaneous recognizer installation/removal matches a
  fresh resolve even when the descendant body is retained.

- **Animation completion criteria now have distinct barriers.**
  `.logicallyComplete` fires when every carrier reaches its final value;
  `.removed` waits until every exit overlay is drained. Both remain immediate
  for empty or disabled batches and fire exactly once.

- **Default fill and border behavior aligns with the preview contract.**
  `Path.contains` and implicit rendering use nonzero fill unless `.evenOdd` is
  explicit. Unlabeled/default `border` placement is inset and does not expand
  sibling allocation; `.outset` remains explicit.

### Fixed

- **`Gesture.updating(_:body:)`'s `inout Transaction` is honored.** The
  body's transaction was previously a discarded stand-in; mutations now
  govern the during-gesture `@GestureState` write (setting
  `transaction.animation` animates it). The transaction arrives inert on
  every update — no preset animation, `isContinuous` not auto-set —
  matching a SwiftUI probe (2026-08-05). The two doc warnings that
  promised the discard are removed.
- **The memo shadow-oracle's wrapper-storage classifier no longer drifts.**
  The diagnostic comparator now classifies property-wrapper storage by
  `DynamicProperty` conformance instead of a hard-coded five-name prefix
  list that omitted `Namespace`, `Bindable`, `FocusedValue`, and
  `FocusedBinding` — and would have omitted every custom wrapper.
  Diagnostic-only: production memo reuse is `Equatable`-gated and
  unaffected.

### Changed

- **Wheel scroll over a `List` or `Table` moves the viewport instead of
  stepping the selection.** Viewport-backed collections now own an explicit
  scroll anchor, and the visible window is derived from it; the selection
  *follows* the window rather than *being* it. This matches SwiftUI. A
  consequence worth knowing: a non-selectable indexed collection can now
  scroll at all, and `ScrollViewProxy.scrollTo(id:)` reaches collection rows,
  neither of which was previously possible.

- **`ScrollView { List }` and `ScrollView { Table }` no longer realize the
  whole dataset per frame.** Realization is viewport-bounded at every dataset
  size. A 10,000-row table's first frame went from ~68 s to ~360 ms in the
  measured A/B.

### Changed (source-breaking)

- **`List` and `Table` now require `SelectionValue: Hashable & Sendable`**,
  narrowed from `Hashable`. In practice this mostly *removes* constraints:
  four `DataCollections` initializers and the `OutlineViews` extension already
  demanded `Sendable` by hand, and the peer `Tab` already required it, so those
  hand-written clauses are gone. Code selecting by a non-`Sendable` value type
  must make that type `Sendable`.

  Note for anyone upgrading with a warm build directory: moving the constraint
  onto the type parameter changes the mangled names of the affected
  initializers, so a stale `.build` produces *link* errors rather than compile
  errors. Clear it.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- Build-hygiene fixes only; no behaviour change. `0.4.3` did not pass its own
  native gate — four warnings-as-errors defects and one test-harness race —
  because every build check in that series filtered compiler warnings out. The
  `0.4.3` tag was deliberately **not** moved: a moved tag trips SwiftPM's
  fingerprint tamper check on every machine that already resolved it.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- **A WebHost scene no longer exits when the browser tab closes.** A client
  disconnect is now connection-local: scene input stays alive, the session ends
  only on server or scene shutdown, and a reconnecting client is assigned a
  greater connection token and re-enters capability negotiation. Late callbacks
  from a superseded connection are ignored rather than acted on.

- **Delta wire records carry their baseline generation.** Records emitted by an
  encoding state now carry additive `epoch` and `gen` keys, and a delta also
  carries `baselineGen`, so a consumer can *reject* a stale, reordered, or
  non-contiguous delta instead of silently applying it to the wrong baseline.
  A `resync` uplink lets any consumer request a keyframe or an image
  re-transmission. All keys are additive-optional; undeclared streams are
  unchanged byte for byte.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- Wire-contract and host-consumer fixes continuing the delivery-coupling work
  begun in `0.4.1`. No authoring-surface API change.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-29

### Changed

- **`Standard` and `FileOpenError` now each have one public identity.**
  The duplicate `SwiftTUIRuntime.Standard` and
  `SwiftTUIRuntime.FileOpenError` identities have been removed during the
  pre-0.9 API-hardening window. Unqualified uses under `import SwiftTUIRuntime`
  or `import SwiftTUI` are unchanged; module-qualified references should use
  `SwiftTUIViews.Standard` and `SwiftTUIViews.FileOpenError`.

- **An unknown wire token degrades one record instead of the session.** Host
  wire token vocabularies are now open-world: a value a newer encoder
  introduces no longer bricks every subsequent frame on a deployed client.

### Fixed

- **`.simultaneousGesture` no longer swallows control activation on a
  stationary click.** Recognizer role survives the RunLoop dispatch seam
  instead of collapsing to a Bool, so a simultaneous gesture recognizes
  *alongside* the control it was declared not to interfere with.
  `Button { … }.simultaneousGesture(DragGesture().onEnded { … })` now activates
  the button. The armed and captured activation paths were also unified, so
  they cannot diverge again — previously a `TapGesture` suppressed its button
  even when the tap *failed* on an off-target release.

- **`myapp < /dev/null` exits instead of parking forever.** The
  terminal-input-ended exit is now reachable in production; previously the
  event pump's stream only finished when both the input and signal streams
  ended, and the signal stream never ended.

- **Dispatched `AsyncParsableCommand` verbs actually run.** All three
  verb-dispatch launch layers now perform the async downcast; previously such a
  verb silently printed help and exited 0.

- **A gesture composed through `body` keeps pointer capture.** User-composed
  gestures wrapping a drag no longer lose capture and stop receiving motion.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- Internal pipeline and teardown work with no authoring-surface API change.

## [0.3.8] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **A `SwiftTUICommand` can claim its own subcommand verbs from raw arguments.**
  A root command that declares an `@Argument` shadows its own subcommands,
  because swift-argument-parser parses the current command's arguments before it
  looks for a verb — `myapp info x.gif` means "open the file named `info`".
  Implement the new `swiftTUIRootSubcommand(forRawArguments:)` requirement,
  typically by delegating to the new `registeredSubcommand(forRawArguments:)`
  helper, and the verb wins. The default implementation returns `nil`, so an app
  that does not implement it is unchanged. Apps no longer need to hand-write a
  `static func main()` restating the framework's launch sequence.

  `completions` is resolved before the hook and cannot be shadowed. Only the
  first argument is examined, and a leading `-` disqualifies a match, so
  `--help`, `--version`, and the `--` terminator fall through by construction. A
  verb beats a same-named file with no filesystem probe; `myapp ./name` and
  `myapp -- name` are the escapes. Two attribution quirks are documented rather
  than papered over: `myapp help verb` stays shadowed (use `myapp verb --help`),
  and a dispatched verb's `--version` reports the verb's own version, failing
  with an unknown-flag error when the verb declares none.

### Fixed

- **A dispatched verb's usage text is attributed to the verb, not the root.**
  Errors carrying their own command stack were already correct, but two cases
  were not: `ParserError.noArguments` (a verb invoked with its required argument
  missing) is rendered against the type passed to `exit(withError:)`, and a
  `ValidationError` thrown from a verb's `run()` carries no stack at all. Both
  now render the verb's usage across all three launch layers.

## [0.3.7] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Terminal handoffs temporarily return the real terminal to an external
  operation.** `TerminalHandoffAction` suspends the runtime input reader,
  restores terminal modes and the primary screen, awaits an editor or other
  interactive operation, then re-enters raw mode and repaints. Calls outside a
  live terminal runtime fail explicitly instead of competing for the TTY.

## [0.3.5] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Host focus binding for embedded terminals.** `TerminalView.hostFocused`
  binds the framework-owned terminal input member to an enum-valued
  `@FocusState`, preserving host key interception and child forwarding without
  an application-owned forwarding wrapper.

## [0.3.4] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- **Host-owned key routing for embedded terminals.** `TerminalView` now offers
  an additive initializer whose routing closure can consume the original
  `KeyPress` before terminal-emulator conversion. The original initializer
  remains source-compatible and forwards every key to the child session.
- **Shared real-terminal journey support.** `SwiftTUITestSupport` now owns the
  PTY pair, bounded ANSI-visible-screen wait, exact-write helper, deadline, and
  cancellation-safe descriptor teardown used by downstream application tests.

### Changed

- **Nested custom and scrolling layouts keep their asynchronous measurement
  stack pointer-sized.** Measurement work items are indirect, preventing the
  released FilePreviewer/Sextant navigation path from exhausting a Dispatch
  worker stack during frame-tail layout.
- **Environment variables now use the single `SWIFTTUI_*` namespace.**
  Framework, host-wire, performance, fixture, and test-harness controls that
  previously used shorter or legacy project prefixes have been renamed without
  compatibility aliases.
- **Radial gradients now fall off in circles.** `RadialGradient` measured
  distance in raw cell space, so a gradient that was circular in cells painted
  as a roughly 2:1 vertical ellipse on screen. The sampler now scales vertical
  offsets by the cell aspect ratio from `CellPixelMetrics`, matching how
  `Circle`, `Ellipse`, and `Capsule` already correct curved geometry. Radii
  stay denominated in horizontal cells: the horizontal reach of an existing
  gradient is unchanged, and only the vertical over-reach is corrected. Fills
  that relied on the old vertical spread should roughly double `endRadius` to
  restore it.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- **Mesh gradients.** `MeshGradient` is a public, animatable `ShapeStyle` for
  validated rectangular point-and-color grids. It renders through fills,
  strokes, borders, tiles, clipping, blending, retained rendering, terminal,
  WebHost/WASI, SwiftUI, and Android paths. Device-space and perceptual Oklab
  interpolation are available through the new `Gradient.ColorSpace` enum.
  Same-topology meshes interpolate points, colors, and background; incompatible
  topology or discrete settings snap to the target value.
- **Mesh performance scenario.** `TermUIPerf synthetic-mesh-gradient` measures
  static, retained, and animated mesh phases at configurable terminal sizes.
  The release implementation measured 0.96x the 3-stop linear-gradient CPU
  cost at 80×24 and 0.89x at 160×48 on the release host, with no dropped frames.

### Changed

- **Host wire styles are appearance-keyed and area-bounded.** Style lookup is
  now O(1), and a full v2 keyframe rebases the epoch before animated
  high-cardinality styles can grow transport state without bound.
- **Source compatibility note:** `AnyShapeStyle` gains the additive
  `meshGradient` case. Downstream exhaustive switches over this pre-1.0 public
  enum must handle the new case.

## [0.1.15] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- **Retained reuse under the stack-lean profile** (opt-in
  `SWIFTTUI_LEAN_RETAINED_REUSE=1`): the browser/WASI stack-lean resolve
  profile can now re-enable the retained-reuse gate alone — a reuse hit
  short-circuits the resolve descent, so it only ever shallows the frame
  relative to the lean baseline; memoized reuse and selective evaluation
  stay off. The runtime-registration restore walks are now explicit work
  lists (never per-level recursion), which is what keeps the reuse-hit
  restore inside the lean stack envelope for any tree depth. Measured on
  WebKit against the granular-observation WebExample: steady worker
  pipeline 27.6 → 10.8 ms/frame (resolve 20.5 → 5.5 ms). Browser hosts on
  stack-lean engines enable the flag by default via `@swifttui/web`
  0.1.15; terminal and native hosts are unaffected (the flag is inert
  outside the lean profile).

### Changed

- **WebHost browser bundle re-vendored at `swift-tui-web` 0.1.15**,
  carrying the lean-engine `SWIFTTUI_LEAN_RETAINED_REUSE=1` default.

## [0.1.13] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- **WebHost browser bundle re-vendored at `swift-tui-web` 0.1.13.** The
  bundle gains hidden-scene suspension: a scene that cannot be seen
  (switched to the background, or any scene while the document is hidden)
  parks its WASI run loop between `poll_oneoff` waits and freezes its
  monotonic clock, so hidden scenes cost no CPU and resume burst-free
  with timers keeping their remaining time. Default on; embedders opt
  out via `suspendHiddenScenes: false` / `suspendWhenHidden: false`.

### Added

- **Presented-Progress Guard** (opt-in via
  `SWIFTTUI_PRESENTED_PROGRESS_GUARD`): with the guard on, a completed
  frame whose presentation diff against the last presented surface is
  non-empty is never drop-eligible
  (`FrameDropBlocker.undeliveredPresentationDamage`) — the bounded
  completed-frame starvation backstop becomes the invariant "undelivered
  pixels are never droppable", uniformly for every host. Value-identical
  rasters (all-zero damage) stay droppable, and the pre-start cancel arm
  is deliberately out of scope. Default off; the pre-committed drop-heavy
  browser rusage A/B (2026-07-21, docs/plans/2026-07-20-001 Stage 5)
  measured the guard eliminating every disposal at per-frame cost parity
  and byte-equivalent behavior under the shipped `async-no-cancel`
  default, but its plain-`.async` cadence (0.674 distinct-generation
  coverage vs the 0.72 fix band) failed the flip's benefit gate — the
  default flip is declined; the guard remains opt-in insurance.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-07-21

### Changed

- **WebHost browser bundle re-vendored at `swift-tui-web` 0.1.12.** No
  Swift source changes. The bundle exits the stack-lean hold on confirmed
  V8 workers (`SWIFTTUI_STACK_LEAN_PROFILE: "0"` by default; JSC and
  Gecko stay lean — Gecko by live measurement), riding 0.1.11's
  `async-no-cancel` disposal default. Live non-lean Chromium measures the
  same distinct-generation coverage as lean at roughly half the per-frame
  pipeline cost, with 100% damage-scoped delta frames in the steady
  window.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **`PerTickPresentCadenceTests`**: composed-runtime per-tick present
  cadence coverage for completed-frame disposal — an autonomous
  Life-shaped tick with deterministic held-tail supersession proves
  `async-no-cancel` presents every completed frame, with a non-lean
  `dropped_completed` red-proof naming the disposal layer, re-run under
  the stack-lean and chunked-resolve WASI-shaped profiles.

### Changed

- **WebHost browser bundle re-vendored at `swift-tui-web` 0.1.11.** No
  Swift source changes. The bundle's `BrowserWASIBridge` now defaults
  browser sessions to `SWIFTTUI_RENDER_MODE=async-no-cancel` (engine-blind,
  both execution modes): completed-frame disposal under supersession —
  not transport publication — was the 0.1.9 live coalescing, and
  ordered commits lift deployed Life distinct-generation coverage
  0.22 → 0.86 with per-frame cost unchanged. The `?renderMode=` page
  seam and caller environments still override.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- **WebHost browser bundle re-vendored at `swift-tui-web` 0.1.10.** No Swift
  source changes. The bundle brings the JSPI main-thread wasm execution mode
  (opt-in), holds the stack-lean profile as the default on every engine, and
  raises the packaged wasm linear-memory stack from 1 MiB to 16 MiB. Together
  these heal two live 0.1.9 Chromium regressions (an Animations-scene
  shadow-stack overflow, and Life frame-emission coalescing under the
  non-lean profile).

## [0.1.9] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- **WebHost browser bundle re-vendored at `swift-tui-web` 0.1.9.** No Swift
  source changes. The bundle adds engine-family detection with an
  engine-differentiated stack-lean default (later reverted in 0.1.10) and
  JSPI capability detection.

## [0.1.8] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- **WASI stack-lean resolve profile** (`SWIFTTUI_STACK_LEAN_PROFILE`):
  default-on for WASI builds, opt-in natively. Swaps per-level task-local
  ambient binds for MainActor save/restore slots and disables retained-reuse,
  memoized reuse, and selective evaluation, bounding the resolve descent's
  stack cost for JavaScriptCore's worker thread-stack budget.
- **Depth-capped chunked resolve** (`DeferredResolveDriver`): a
  drain-and-rerun fixpoint that cuts the resolve descent at structural child
  edges past a depth limit (default K=6 under the lean profile;
  `SWIFTTUI_RESOLVE_DEPTH_LIMIT` tunes or force-enables it) and re-resolves
  deferred subtrees from a fresh shallow stack. This fixes the Safari/WebKit
  stack overflow that broke the browser demo on JavaScriptCore.

### Fixed

- **Lean-profile async ambient reads.** Under the stack-lean profile,
  ambient-context reads now fall back to the task-local slot
  (`leanCurrent ?? taskLocalCurrent`), restoring `.task`-closure visibility of
  authoring/environment context. Previously state writes from async tasks
  degraded to detached boxes and produced no frames (the frozen Game of
  Life).

## [0.1.7] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **Gesture composition**: inter-tap timeout for multi-tap counts, exclusive
  gesture hand-off with replay, and `SimultaneousGesture`/`SequenceGesture`.
- **Typed navigation data paths** and **data-driven dismissal**;
  presentation surfaces now stack.
- **Node-hosted collection rows** and windowed lazy-stack realization:
  lazy stacks realize and measure only the scroll viewport's window, with
  drift correction pinned by tests.
- SwiftUI-parity wiring: object environment values, `withTransaction`,
  spring `initialVelocity`; off-main `@Observable` writes are marshaled
  instead of trapping.

### Changed

- Teardown reachability unified behind a single barrier entrypoint with
  census-adjudicated spares; legacy lifetime ledgers retired.
- Performance program: reuse-gate invalidation queries inverted to the
  invalidated set, unchanged-commit effect republication scoped to an owner
  index, animation deadline work scoped, collection baseline scenarios
  (`lazy-list-1k`, `table-1kx4`) added.

### Fixed

- A large fix batch from the gallery fuzz campaign, including: toolbar chrome
  proposal fill, adopted-slot conditional transitions, location-free drop
  dispatch fallback, node-backed style bodies with adopted authoring owners,
  superseded task starts in merged lifecycle plans, paired pointer-route
  release with departed gesture recognizers, and pass-stable `onChange`
  previous-value reads.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-07-13

### Removed

- **BREAKING: the `SwiftTUICharts` product moved to its own repository,
  [`SwiftTUI/swift-tui-charts`](https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-charts).**
  `swift-tui` no longer declares a `SwiftTUICharts` product or target. Keep
  your `import SwiftTUICharts` lines as they are, add the new package
  dependency, and change the product's `package:` identity:

  ```swift
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui.git", exact: "<version>"),
    .package(url: "https://github.com/SwiftTUI/swift-tui-charts.git", exact: "<version>"),
  ],
  // in the target:
  .product(name: "SwiftTUICharts", package: "swift-tui-charts"),
  ```

### Added

- `AccessibilityVisualContent` is now public, and the public
  `SemanticMetadata` initializer accepts `accessibilityVisualContent:`, so
  external view libraries can participate in the missing-label accessibility
  diagnostics contract.
- The published `SwiftTUIViews` product re-exports `SwiftTUICore` (which
  re-exports `SwiftTUIGraph` and `SwiftTUIPrimitives`), making
  `import SwiftTUIViews` a self-sufficient authoring surface for external
  view libraries — the same re-export shape `SwiftTUIRuntime` already had.

### Changed

- The absorbed Vendor targets are renamed with a `SwiftTUIVendor` prefix
  (`UnixSignals` → `SwiftTUIVendorUnixSignals`, `SwiftFiglet` →
  `SwiftTUIVendorFiglet`, `EmbeddedFonts` → `SwiftTUIVendorFigletEmbeddedFonts`,
  `GIF`/`JPEG`/`PNG` → `SwiftTUIVendor{GIF,JPEG,PNG}`, the `figlet` executable →
  `SwiftTUIVendorFigletCLI`). SwiftPM requires target names to be unique across
  the whole package graph, so under their upstream names these targets collided
  with packages that ship the originals (e.g. swift-service-lifecycle's
  `UnixSignals`). No public product changes name; the vendored modules were
  never importable by consumers.
- Documented that `DefaultRenderer.render(_:)` is a one-shot snapshot/preview
  entry point and is **not** focus/press-reuse-safe across successive calls
  (focus/press state is excluded from the reuse snapshot and protected by the
  run loop's suppression scope, which the one-shot path does not compute) — drive
  interactive rendering through the run loop. Clarified the `EquatableView`
  documentation: it wraps an already-`Equatable` `Content` and relocates the
  reuse boundary onto its own node; prefer conforming the boundary view to
  `Equatable` directly unless a distinct boundary node is needed.
- Added a DEBUG memoization diagnostic (`SWIFTTUI_MEMO_TRACE` → `inert_equatable`)
  that flags an `Equatable` / `.equatable()` boundary which is never memo-reused
  because it reads `@State`/`@Observable`/focus state — surfacing a silently inert
  opt-in. The reflective comparator path is now DEBUG-only (the production gate is
  `Equatable`-only); no public API change.

## [0.0.21] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- **`EquatableView` and `View.equatable()`** (SwiftUI parity). Wrapping a
  read-free boundary view (or conforming it to `Equatable`) lets the renderer
  reuse its whole committed subtree via a single `==` when the value is
  unchanged, instead of re-evaluating it under an invalidated ancestor. `==` is
  a correctness contract — see the `EquatableView` docs.

### Changed

- **Memoized-body reuse is on by default.** When a node reached under an
  invalidated ancestor is `Equatable`-equal to its previous value, reads no
  `@State`/`@Observable`/focus state, and passes the retained-reuse guards, its
  committed subtree is reused instead of recomputed. The gate is `Equatable`-only
  (a true opt-in): inert on views that do not conform to `Equatable` (measured
  within noise on non-opt-in trees), a large `resolve` win on those that do. Set
  `SWIFTTUI_MEMO_REUSE=0` to disable.

## [0.0.19] - 2026-06-10

Lockstep release across the SwiftTUI org. Headline: a first preview of the
host-managed Android surface.

### Added

- **Android host (early preview).** A new `SwiftTUIAndroidHost` library
  product and target under `Platforms/Android`: hosts SwiftTUI scenes behind
  a `swift_tui_android_*` C ABI for JNI/Compose embedders, publishing
  semantic host frames — styled cells, terminal colors,
  underline/strikethrough decorations, image attachment records and
  payloads, accessibility nodes and announcements, focus presentation, and
  preferred layout size — as versioned JSON snapshots. Verified rendering
  the gallery example on an arm64-v8a emulator. IME composition, clipboard,
  link opening, and precise drag/scroll gestures remain follow-up work.
- A platform-neutral `HostedSurfaceSizeNegotiator` in `SwiftTUIRuntime`,
  shared by the SwiftUI and Android hosts for hosted-surface size
  negotiation.
- Ordered raster presentation layers.
- GIF blend-behavior test coverage.
- A complete copy-pasteable `Package.swift` example in the README.
- README disclosure of the `#12` run-loop memory-corruption known issue.

### Changed

- Broad Android compatibility across core, runtime, profiling, and terminal
  I/O (`canImport(Android)` paths); the package cross-builds for
  `aarch64-unknown-linux-android28` with the official Swift Android SDK.
- Presentation sheets render with single-line full-bleed chrome.
- `perf(termui)`: sheet-open-latency benchmark plus gated additive-overlay
  raster reuse.
- README: the web packages are now installed from npm
  (`npm install @swifttui/web @swifttui/build`); the GitHub-release tarball URLs
  are documented as a secondary, pin-a-release-asset option.
- `docs/VISION-GAP.md` restored at `HEAD` (five docs link to it) and brought
  current: npm publishing and still-`Image` blend-mode precomposition are now
  recorded as shipped.

## [0.0.18] - 2026-06-07

Lockstep release across the SwiftTUI org, reconciling a prior version skew (a
solo `0.0.17` tag carrying the breaking `Canvas`/`CanvasContext` redesign that
the rest of the org had not followed). Includes the image-blend-mode
precomposition work (still images), cache hardening, and glyph-aware backdrops.
