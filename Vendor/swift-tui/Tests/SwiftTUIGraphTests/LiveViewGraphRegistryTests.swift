/// The registry's two correctness properties are weak retirement (a retired
/// graph resolves to `nil`, so an imperative read falls back to the seed) and
/// scope isolation (a scope only ever resolves *its own* graph, never a
/// different live one — the structural guarantee against cross-session leaks).
