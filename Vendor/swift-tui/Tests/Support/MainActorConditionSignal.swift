/// A producer calls `notify()` after each state change it owns; a waiter
/// suspends in `wait(until:)` and is resumed the instant its predicate first
/// holds — re-evaluated only on `notify()`, never on a clock.
///
/// Because there is no timeout, a starved producer never makes a waiter *fail*:
/// the waiter simply stays suspended until the producer runs. The test
/// synchronises on the state change, not on the wall clock.
