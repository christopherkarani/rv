/// timeout (60–75 minutes on the example gates).
///
/// Every ``RealTerminalPTYPair`` arms one watchdog in `open` and disarms it
/// when its master descriptor closes. Progress is any harness traffic on an
/// armed pair — a wait starting or finishing, bytes read, bytes written — and
/// each one is recorded as a heartbeat. The process counts as stalled once the
/// smallest armed pair's `stallBudget` passes with no heartbeat; every consumer
/// wait carries a deadline well inside the default budget, so healthy journeys
/// that run for minutes keep heartbeating and are never affected.
///
/// The watchdog lives OUTSIDE the test process, and is deliberately built from
/// nothing but POSIX calls. The first `open` in a process `posix_spawn`s one
/// `/bin/sh` sidecar for the whole process; it polls a heartbeat file four
/// times a second and, on a stall, prints a diagnostic to the inherited stderr
/// (the CI log) and signals the test process: SIGCONT and SIGABRT first, so a
/// runtime with crash reporting enabled dumps its threads, then SIGKILL. It
/// exits on its own when the test process is gone. Nothing inside the test
/// process is trusted, and neither is Foundation: Swift Testing's `.timeLimit`
/// cannot stop a body that never reaches a suspension point; the 0.9.8 example
/// gates wedged a process so thoroughly that an in-process libdispatch timer
/// never ran; and the org root's pretag job then showed `Foundation.Process.run()`
/// itself never returning in that process — a sidecar spawned through it, per
/// pair, never came to exist. Spawning once, early, through `posix_spawn` is
