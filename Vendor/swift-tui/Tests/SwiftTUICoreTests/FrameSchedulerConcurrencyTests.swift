/// Concurrency-safety regression for `FrameScheduler`.
///
/// The scheduler's coalescing state is mutated by `request*` from any thread and
/// drained by the main-actor run loop via `consumeReadyFrame`. It used to be
/// lock-free and safe only "by convention" (every caller on the main actor),
/// which raced the run loop when an off-main caller — notably the Observation
/// `onChange` bridge firing from a background mutation — broke that convention.
/// These tests hammer the scheduler from many concurrent tasks; run them under
/// ThreadSanitizer (`swift test --sanitize=thread`) to prove the coalescing
/// state is race-free. Without the lock, the intent counter loses increments
/// (counts come out below the request total) and TSan reports the data race.
