// Bound-at-capture state ownership (plan 2026-08-20-001, Stages 1–3).
//
// Stage-1 unit coverage drives the capture slot and read-path rungs directly
// with hand-injected bindings; Stage-2/3 coverage resolves real views through
// the central resolver with the gate on and exercises the closures their
// bodies captured — outside any ambient dispatch context, the exact shape
// that used to bottom out at the authored seed.
//
// The no-invalidator resolver harness mirrors imperative writes into the box
// seed (the triage's false-green trap), so these tests distinguish routing by
// the DEBUG census counters, not by value alone; the live invalidator-backed
// behavioral A/B lives in SwiftTUITests/CaptureBindingLiveStateTests.swift.
