/// Pins the imperative-dispatch hardening for the stale-`@State`-in-action-
/// closure bug class: every failure path used to end in a *silent* fallback
/// to the authored seed. Two contracts are pinned here:
///
/// 1. `withImperativeAuthoringContext(nil)` preserves the caller's ambient
///    authoring context. A nil registration snapshot means "registration saw
///    no context", not "clear the context" — installing nil severed a nested
///    dispatch (a user closure firing inside a control's established
///    dispatch context, the `onSubmit` shape) from the ambient owner.
/// 2. An imperative `@State` access that bottoms out at the authored seed on
///    a box that was previously graph-bound records a
///    `state.imperativeSeedFallback` runtime issue instead of failing
///    silently.
