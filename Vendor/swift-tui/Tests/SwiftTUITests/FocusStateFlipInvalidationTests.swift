/// Runtime `@FocusState` flips are reader-attributed: when focus-sync applies
/// a focus change to a bound `@FocusState` (the `applyRuntimeFocus` leg of
/// `LocalFocusBindingRegistry.sync`), the invalidation targets the slot's
/// recorded readers — the `.focused()` registration site (which must
/// re-register with fresh `isSelected`) and any body that genuinely read the
/// value — not the owner's whole identity. A body that merely *projects* the
/// binding (`$focus`) hosts the storage but presents nothing derived from it,
/// so its sibling content must keep retained reuse across the flip.
///
/// Authored requests (`focus = true` from an action) keep the owner-identity
/// invalidation: a pending request must reach a re-resolve of the
/// registration site to be consumed, and the owner cone guarantees that
/// regardless of reader attribution.
