/// Pins the contract that bit the gallery "Logo Breaker" demo: an autonomous
/// `.task` loop that *reads* a `@State` flag observes the gesture's live writes
/// **whether or not the view body also reads that flag** during resolve. This
/// matches SwiftUI, where a `.task`'s `@State` read is always live.
///
/// The mechanism that used to make the body read matter: a `.task` runs outside
/// a resolve pass, so its `@State` read resolves through a graph-backed location
/// *remembered* during resolve. A flag the body read got such a location; a flag
/// the body never read (it appeared only inside gesture closures) did not, and
/// the read fell back to the box's seed — which the gesture's write, made
/// through a different box's seed, never updated. The loop then saw a
/// permanently-stale value: in `LogoTab` the `guard !isDragging` silently never
/// fired, so gravity ran underneath an active drag and the held ball fell.
///
/// The framework fix recovers the live owner node from the captured graph scope
/// (`LiveViewGraphRegistry`) when an imperative `@State` access finds no
/// remembered location, so both reads and writes reach the graph slot directly.
/// Both probes below must now freeze the held drag — the body-read variant and
/// the body-never-reads variant alike — so neither the fix nor a regression of
/// it can drift unnoticed.
///
/// Harness note (fixed flake #4 in swift-tui-org/docs/swift-tui/KNOWN-TEST-FLAKES.md):
/// the two variants run CONCURRENTLY, so all probe bookkeeping lives in a per-run
/// `ProbeGrabState` instance — a shared singleton let one variant read the
/// other's grab values under CI load. The grab offset is captured live inside
/// the gesture closure, never scraped from a presented frame: the tick loop
/// advances on wall-clock sleeps while frame presentation can coalesce, so no
/// frame bearing the exact grab tick is guaranteed to exist.
