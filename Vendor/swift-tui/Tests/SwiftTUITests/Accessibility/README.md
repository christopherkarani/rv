# Accessibility Listening Review

This directory documents the manual listening surface that complements the
committed semantic, Web/WASI, and SwiftUI host tests.

## VoiceOver

Use VoiceOver on macOS for both the terminal (cursor-follows-focus) and the
SwiftUI host.

1. Start the gallery in accessible mode (reduced motion plus
   cursor-follows-focus, so the screen reader tracks the hardware cursor):
   `swiftly run swift run --package-path ../swift-tui-examples/gallery gallery-demo --accessible`
2. Make sure that tab changes, focused controls, text input labels,
   and `AccessibilityAnnouncer` messages are spoken in logical order.
3. Exercise visual-only screens such as images, charts, canvas demos, and
   animated content. They must expose meaningful labels or summaries, or be
   skipped when intentionally hidden.
4. Repeat the same flows in the SwiftUI host when the change touches native host
   mapping or platform announcements.

## Browser

The browser target is the preferred repeatable listening path because it mounts
the semantic stream as ARIA beside the raster canvas.

1. Start the gallery web surface:
   `swiftly run swift run --package-path ../swift-tui-examples/gallery gallery-demo --web --port 8080`
2. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080` and use the browser accessibility inspector to
   make sure that roles, names, focus, and live regions are correct.
3. Listen with VoiceOver, NVDA, or Orca depending on host platform.
4. Make sure that imperative announcements use the expected `aria-live` priority and
   do not replay old live-region baselines.

## NVDA

Use NVDA on Windows against the browser target.

1. Run the app with `--web` from a reachable host or WASI/browser build.
2. Navigate with Tab and arrow keys through controls, tabs, text inputs, and
   menus.
3. Make sure that state is not color-only. Selected, focused, disabled, success,
   warning, and error states must have text, glyph, role, label, or position
   cues in addition to color.

## Orca

Use Orca on Linux against the browser target, and against the terminal when
the terminal and shell combination is known to be readable.

1. Start with `--accessible --ascii` when testing terminal output.
2. Prefer the browser target for role/focus regressions.
3. Make sure that visual-only content is either summarized or skipped consistently.

## Release Evidence

Record the screen reader, target, OS, browser or terminal, app command, and
observed pass/fail notes in the PR or release checklist. Listening failures
must become semantic snapshot tests, Web/WASI transport tests, or SwiftUI host
mapping tests when the behavior is deterministic.
