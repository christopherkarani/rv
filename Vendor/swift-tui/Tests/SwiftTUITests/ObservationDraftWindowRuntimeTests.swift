/// The draft-window observation deafness class (the amd64 stack-lean cadence
/// stall): in the abortable pipeline a frame's observation draft stays
/// unpublished across the async tail. A model write landing in that window
/// fires — and consumes — the one-shot registration armed during the frame's
/// resolve, whose pass is newer than anything published. Dropping that fire
/// outright leaves observation permanently deaf for the identity: no
/// invalidation, no next frame, and nothing ever re-arms the tracking.
///
/// The held raster gate makes the window deterministic on every machine
/// (frame latency ≥ writer cadence is the organic trigger, which only slow
/// runners hit): hold the write-driven frame's tail, write again mid-hold,
/// release, and require the second write's value to reach the surface.
