/// Property pins for ``AnimationTickResult.redrawIdentities``.
///
/// Background: a `.blendBorder(blend:)` whose phase is driven by
/// `withAnimation(.linear.repeatForever)` schedules a 30 FPS tick.
/// `redrawIdentities` describes which view identities the tick
/// touched, which downstream consumers (the incremental presentation
/// diff in the render pipeline) use to decide which subtrees to
/// re-rasterize.
///
/// Phase 4 removed the wake-up gate that used to skip
/// `requestDeadline(_:)` when `redrawIdentities.isDisjoint(with:
/// drawnIdentities)` — the gate had a one-way trap with stranded
/// drains and was replaced with the explicit ``hasPendingWork``
/// signal.  These tests still pin the descriptive property: when the
/// animated view sits below a clipped viewport the affected identity
/// must NOT appear in the frame's `drawnIdentities`, and when the
/// view is visible it MUST appear.  Even though no production code
/// gates on this disjointness anymore, the invariant remains a
/// useful pin on the placed-tree clip walk.
