// Frame-instant totality guards.
//
// A frame is *about* one instant: its triggering deadline, or the reading it
// was consumed at. Everything inside that frame's lifetime — the animation
// timestamp, deadline re-arms, superseded-batch parks, and the pre-start-cancel
// and supersession gates — reads that one value.
//
// The shape this prevents: `computeFrameHead` stamped the draft from
// `MonotonicInstant.now()`, then `injectAnimations` sampled the clock AGAIN and
// overwrote the stamp, and the G2/G4 gates asked the wall clock while the
// consume they gate asked the injectable seam. Under the real clock those
// readings differ by microseconds and nothing looks wrong; under a virtual
// clock they differ by the whole test, which is why cadence could only ever be
// tested by driving a live session under a hang bound.
