/// A registration authored at an `Equatable` memo boundary's own identity is
/// recorded on the boundary node, and that node is then absorbed into its
/// parent (the chain-collapse stamp fixed point) — `adoptRuntimeRegistrations`
/// moves the record onto a live node.
///
/// The record's owner key had to move with it. The registries restore owner
/// keys verbatim from the record, and their owner-liveness passes
/// (`prune(keeping:)`) prove departure from the key's `viewNodeID` alone — so
/// an adopted entry still naming the absorbed node was torn down on the next
/// pass even though a live node carried its record. The gesture reached its
/// resolve, registered, and was pruned before the first event.
///
/// The shape matters: the attachment must be the memo boundary body's ROOT, so
/// its identity collapses onto the boundary node. Wrapping the body in a
/// container gives the attachment its own live node and hides the defect.
