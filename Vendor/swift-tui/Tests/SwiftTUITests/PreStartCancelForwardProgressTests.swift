/// Forward-progress guarantee for the cancelled-before-start path.
///
/// A prepared frame whose commit would stop an invalidation source (a tab
/// leave carrying the leaving tab's `taskCancel`) can be superseded by that
/// very source on every cycle: each new intent cancels the queued tail before
/// it starts, the intent is replayed, and the replay is cancelled in turn —
/// forever (the gallery tab-leave livelock, report 2026-07-05-001). The
/// completed-frame drop policy's `progress_starvation` guard bounds
/// consecutive visual-only DROPS, but pre-start cancels had no analogous
/// bound.
///
/// The supersession side of the race is made deterministic by a scheduler
/// that reports a pending frame on every poll, and the queued window is held
/// open by blocking the layout worker — so without the bound the cancel
/// cycle is guaranteed, and with it the third head is guaranteed to park
/// uncancellable. All synchronisation is on `RunLoopProgressProbe` events;
/// the assertions read the retained event log, so no wall-clock waits are
/// involved.
// The time limit is a HANG bound, not a performance assertion: in isolation
// the suite finishes in ~20ms, but under the full parallel test run every
// probe-event hop contends for the main actor with hundreds of suites
// (measured 54s on an 18-core Linux VM; over 60s on the 4-core CI runner,
// which failed a 1-minute limit).
