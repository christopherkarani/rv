// F16 totality guards — the single-capture-point invariant, enforced by
// source scrape (pattern: `ViewGraphCheckpointTotalityTests`).
//
// `HandlerDescriptorIntake` exists so that a handler registration site cannot
// miss the authoring-context capture / environment stamp / dispatch wrap
// (the stale-`@State`-binding family: 7e17a984, 678cc78e, c32bf74a). These
// guards keep the seam total:
//
// 1. No file in Sources/SwiftTUIViews outside the named exemptions may bake
//    `withImperativeAuthoringContext` into a closure — that is the intake's
//    job. Exemptions are dispatch/construction seams, not registration sites.
// 2. No file outside the intake (plus named data-registration and
//    recognizer-seam exemptions) may call a runtime registry registration
//    method directly.
// 3. Every closure-carrying registry accessor on `ResolveContext` is either
//    forwarded by the intake or a named data/recognizer exemption — a new
//    registry family cannot ship without joining the capture seam (or being
//    deliberately exempted here, which is the review hook).

struct HandlerDescriptorIntakeTotalityTests {
  /// Dispatch/construction seams that legitimately re-establish an
  /// imperative authoring context outside the intake:
  /// - `State/AuthoringContext.swift` — defines the machinery.
  /// - `State/HandlerDescriptorIntake.swift` — the capture point itself.
  /// - `Environment/EnvironmentActions.swift` — semantic action values
  ///   (OpenLinkAction et al.) self-wrap at value construction; they are
  ///   built from environment reads, not at a resolve site.
  /// - `ActionScopes/ToolbarItem.swift` — `ToolbarItemConfig.init`'s
  ///   construction-time capture stays innermost so a config built inside an
  ///   authoring context wins over the attachment-scope fallback.
  /// - `Gestures/GestureModifierDecorators.swift` — the recognizer
  ///   decorators ARE the dispatch seam for gesture callbacks; they
  ///   re-establish the scope captured at `_makeRecognizer` (which runs
  ///   under the intake's `withRegistrationEnvironmentScope`).
  /// - `Animation/WithAnimation.swift` — `withAnimation(…, completion:)` is a
  ///   free function the *user* calls (from an action closure, a `.task`, or
  ///   anywhere else), so it has no `ResolveContext` to build an intake from
  ///   and no registry to forward to; it self-wraps at registration, the same
  ///   shape as `EnvironmentActions`. The wrap is required rather than
  ///   optional: the controller fires completions outside any resolve pass,
  ///   and an unwrapped `@State` write there degrades to
  ///   `box.updateSeedValue` — silently, since the setter has no failure
  ///   channel. That is this comment block's own "missed capture" family,
  ///   which is why the site is named here rather than left to drift.
