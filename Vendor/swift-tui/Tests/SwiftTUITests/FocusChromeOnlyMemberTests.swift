/// root-path has NO evaluation-time runtime-focus reader (a metadata-only
/// `.focusable()` container — nothing at or above it consults
/// `focusedIdentity`/`pressedIdentity`/`isFocused` while resolving) needs no
/// recompute cone at all. Its focus presentation is host-side chrome derived
/// from the committed semantic snapshot, and descendants compare focus
/// against their own identities, which did not change.
///
/// The old/new focus identities still ride the suppression scope as

/// currencies (scope matching and the tracker's move notification, filtered
/// at the source).
///
/// The soundness boundary: any flagged reader at or above the focus identity
/// (framework controls read the side-fields self-or-descendant-equality
/// style — `List` compares its row identities, `Button` itself) keeps the
/// full member cone, because the reader's re-run may hand fresh values into
/// the focused subtree.
